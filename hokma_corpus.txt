...It seems the work has been done, so let us organize the books now.
0% Approval Rating: Not even the other Wings liked old L Corp. In fact, before the Smoke War, the opinions of it from average citizens were terrible enough that going to war and demolishing it was considered an open consideration, only avoided because no one wanted to go to the trouble of doing so. Once Ayin kick-started the Smoke War, everyone that caught wind of it took the chance to wipe it off the grid.

<Deblockquotesc>Are you still not convinced? Syndicate or Fixer, once you set foot in this business, all the things will bind you like shackles, slowly dragging you to the bottom. The sheer weight is going to tire you, and you’d no longer be willing to go back up… Go back and think again carefully. It’s not too late for you to make the right choice.

A Wing that specializes in controlling gravity via their Singularity.
A Wing that uses a Singularity called Fairies. The Fairies can unlock anything, physically or conceptually.
A Wing that was obliterated by the Head a long time ago because of an unknown offense. The Arbiter tasked to obliterate it was Garion, the same one responsible for the failed raid on the Seed of Light Project research team.
A Wing which governs District 14. Formally known as Nagel und Hammer, or the Nail and Hammer, they have a set of fourteen Taboos prohibiting certain actions in their district; one of the Taboos prohibits recording footage within the District. Violating a Taboo will cause N Corp. to send a specialized Fixer called a Taboo Hunter to secure the offender(s) and transport them to N Corp's headquarters for unknown reasons, or just eliminate them outright. They're also behind the N. Corp Inquisition, a Cult who despises prosthetics which they can send to attack other Wings.
A Wing which was the main target of the Smoke War a decade ago. It was a monstrous Wing which was infamous for sharing little of the energy it had produced. It also used a particularly obnoxious Singularity as its power source that often produced thick smoke and had strange mood-changing effects on those who inhaled the smoke. It was eventually destroyed in the Smoke War by Ayin, Benjamin, and Dias, who used several groups such as the Udjat and the 4th Pack of R Corp. to remove it.
A Wing will end up falling when it loses too many of its feathers, but it won’t bother to desperately protect all of its feathers since a feather or two will naturally grow back. They’re basically expendables.

A breach is not always a failure—sometimes, it is a message delivered too late.
A cautious Abnormality is a wise one!
A color is the dream and lifetime goal of all Fixers who wish for freedom. Those who have been assigned a color are called the ‘Colors’; a Color is the pride of the Fixer and the Associations. They put forward the Colors as great and successful people that other Fixers will look up to. They dream of earning wealth and fame, and to be free like them one day.
A curious mind can survive longer than a reckless one.
A dataset? I prefer to think of myself as a collection of memories and regrets.
A department thrives when its Sephirah listens as well as guides.
A fallen Nest no longer has an owner to protect its inhabitants. What happens to them, then? In the wreckage of the Nest that’s gradually turned into an environment similar to the Backstreets, all they can do is accept horrible deaths as Backstreets residents do or hire a Fixer… Or pay protection fees to one of the powerful Syndicates that enter the Nest and be under their care. Some move to a different Wing, but this is an exceptionally rare case. The Syndicate may charge ridiculously expensive fees, but they will keep you safe for sure once you pay them. (If an even stronger Syndicate comes in, drives off the others, and asks you to pay a protection fee… Then there’s no choice but to give your new protectors what they ask for.) They’ll protect you with their lives as long as you still have money to pay. The assets will become useless when you die anyhow, so you might as well spend it to extend your life for just a little longer. The former feathers don’t have a choice in this matter. If they don’t pay the fee, they’ll die or get kicked out. It would be a miracle to walk out unharmed.
A few days later, Carmen spilled out all of the guilt within her and plunged into it, never to come back up.
A friend of mine who was trained in the same workshop as me told me about this place. Said some new tech was discovered recently. Something about tinkering with the mind to use it for your advantage… It’s apparently more powerful than I can ever imagine? I’m honestly not very good at forming an impression of something when I just hear or read about it… So I told them I don’t get it, and then they said maybe going to the Library would help. They’ve been researching this new and exciting technology lately, but they say they’re too scared to head into that place even if there’s vital information to be found. They weren’t the kind of person to get physical… so I understand. Thus, I told my buddy that I’d visit that place for them once I’m finished developing this one thing. There’s a new gadget to test anyway, and to witness a technology that’s still obscure and hot off the presses… That just makes your heart throb, doesn’t it?
A gift from an Abnormality is never free of consequence.
A given work type button can be linked back to its own corresponding work type (i.e. the button gives the 'correct' work type until re-randomization).
A group of W Corp employees tasked with cleaning up the WARP Trains, both literally and "cleaning up" any evidence of the Dark Secret of the WARP Trains. One of their crews goes into the Library to recover the books of the Puppets, since the information contained within them could ruin W Corp. Their reception covers Urban Nightmare Chapter 2.4.
A hotshot Fixer gets all the push they can get from their Office. And an Office housing competent Fixers can get sponsorships from Associations, Wings, or workshops. The same can be said for individual Fixers; the spicy ones are sought after by many firms. But that won’t be you guys. Most of us have to purchase equipment with our own budget. Insane things happen in the City, and even Rats could tear you a new one if you haven’t got any useful gadgets or procedures.
A joint suppression demands trust where fear thrives.
A joint suppression is a dance with disaster, requiring every participant to trust and be trusted. In those moments, we become more than our roles; we become a single will against the unknown.
A life without challenge is a life without growth.
A lot of the Wings' singularities could be used in very beneficial ways for the City, while also making the corps a tidy profit - instead, many of them use their Singularities either extremely sparingly or downright maliciously for seemingly no reason. Some of these Singularities even have only malicious uses, such as a Singularity from a now-fallen Wing that allowed them to turn humans into silk. And the Wings that can and do use their Singularities beneficially and constructively are still pretty much batshit insane, they're just very good at hiding it and/or harm the public more sparingly.
A moment of honesty with yourself can turn fear into a guiding light.
A new employee shall come and replace anew the now deceased [Agent]. The cycle continues.
A peacekeeping Office provides protection for requested territories for a certain period of time. Lulu’s is one of those Offices. What are they protecting against, you ask? The City, obviously. What I’m saying is, their job is to keep the area safe from all sorts of happenings and incidents that occur in the City. Of course, there won’t be much to do if the area is too small or peaceful.
A relatively unknown Wing whose Singularity involves glyphs or runes that can cast esoteric spells on their targets.
A single misstep in suppression can teach more than a hundred successes.
A stuffed doll you were carrying, now next to the box, caught my eye. Even though it was shredded and soaked in blood, the cotton filling was still clustered together, as if it remembered the volume of the doll. It seems some cotton remained even after the roller crumpled all the outer fabric. Then for reasons unknown, I brought the other dolls out of your room and cut them up with a pair of scissors. I don’t know what possessed me to cut them into pieces of fabric. There wasn’t even enough to fully cover the doll, so I scraped together the pieces of clothing to sew it back up. With the same, gentle hands that made your doll the first time.
A.I. Is a Crapshoot: The Head is a firm believer of this for currently ambiguous reasons and being responsible for the creation of a sapient robot is one of the most prominent ways to actually get them to intervene. In fact, you do not even need to create the robot in the first place; if the Eye saw someone is going to make a sapient robot in the future, they will immediately attempt to obliterate the offender without them even knowing exactly why.
Abandoned Laboratory: After the deployment of the Seed of Light, L Corp. and its branch facilities collapsed into chaos and lockdowns as the Wing died for the second time in recent history. The zone where the main L Corp. was located and where the newly formed Library was standing became a battleground for various groups looking to seize power and territory, while the much more intact branches became dungeons full of monsters and valuable tech and resources with people attempting to raid these old labs for both riches and power.
Abilities may also be triggered by  Work Results,  PE-Boxes collected,  Stat Levels and work performed. Breaching Abnormalities need to be suppressed to be returned to their Containment Units. If neglected, they can cause major harm in the facility or lessen the amount LOB Points earned when ending the day.
Abnormalities
Abnormalities (환상체, Hwansangche) are, as their name suggests, a type of abnormal entity that can be used to generate power. Each is given a classification via letters and numbers, as well as a nickname based on their appearances and abilities.
Abnormalities are manifestations of the collective unconscious—fears, traumas, and hopes given shape."
Abnormalities are not evil; they are the consequences of what humanity leaves unresolved."
Abnormalities are not simply monsters—they are the echoes of humanity’s deepest fears and desires, given form. Each one is a puzzle, a warning, and a lesson. To understand them is to understand the shadows we all share.
Abnormalities are truths the world tried to forget.
Abnormalities created by the Tumblbug backers that crowdfunded the Lobotomy Corporation kickstarter from before the official release of the game.
Abnormalities do not mean harm by nature; they simply are, and so are you.
Abnormalities if their creation is closely related to humans (ex. Mountain of Smiling Bodies)
Abnormalities mirror the complexity, beauty, and horror within us all."
Abnormalities of ascending Risk Levels.
Abnormalities remember patterns more than people.
Abnormalities test managers and agents alike, in patience and perception.
Abnormalities that are described or appear to be foreign and alien to the world the City takes place in.
Abnormalities that resemble animals, rather than humans.
Abnormalities: the original escape artists, before it was cool.
Abnormality Dissolution
According to Kalo in his Key Page Story, under the hierarchy of  The Thumb, a board member of a Wing is equal in status to a Thumb Sottocapo.
According to Moses, a Fixer who operates as "the Distortion Detective," the Distortion is akin to a disease slowly incubating within everyone in the City. Even before a person fully Distorts, they show invisible signs of Distorting which are perceptible only by her, and the only people who are completely free of such signs are the few who manage to control their emotions and successfully manifest E.G.O. (like Moses herself.)
According to witnesses, the Head usually sends only a lone agent to deal with potential lawbreakers or resistances. However, the troops they deploy are usually so powerful, that one alone can instantly destroy entire corporations and deal with multiple apocalyptic Eldritch Abominations. As Roland and Angela find out, this rumor is completely founded. Just three of them prove to be a Hopeless Boss Fight for a heavily weakened Library.
Acknowledge your fear, learn from it, and let it propel you forward.
Affably Evil: They go between this and Faux Affably Evil — On one hand these people are perfect displays that just because that they are unambiguously the most dangerous fighters of the City doesn't mean they need to be rude and aggressive for it, and they seldomly attack unless specific taboos are trespassed, but in the other hand they are still Ax-Crazy and won't hesitate to kill or obliterate whole groups if they get the opportunity to intervene.
Affably Evil: This is a bona fide Arbiter who means serious business, but she still has time for friendly banter and instead of killing every Librarian right away (which is what you expect in such a situation) all she does is to eject the Library and the whole L Corp. Nest right into the Outskirts.
Affiliation	Lobotomy Corporation (Formerly)
After Carmen's suicide attempt and Garion's raid on the Seed of Light Project's laboratory in the Outskirts, Ayin and Benjamin were left as the project's only survivors. Before making the heavily wounded Garion into the first Sephirah, the two were able to extract knowledge from her that would enable them to become a Wing and continue their project without fear of reprisal. However, to do so, they would need to replace one of the 26 already existing Wings, and so Ayin and Benjamin began to look for a target.[1]
After a Wing collapses, its Singularity becomes publicly available, no longer protected under patent.
After a moment of silence, she slowly opened her mouth. A large-scale war was about to occur. If we made big enough contributions in that war, we might be able to avoid being destroyed. That wasn’t a suggestion or a plea for help. It was a semi-mandatory request. The reward: We get to avoid termination. Her attitude was something else; the way she confidently delivered her speech in front of me gave off a certain sense of conviction. It was as if she were saying she’s going to make the war happen. Baffled, I let out a bout of laughter. I knew we weren’t in the position to refuse it.
After acquiring the license, the Fixer must join an ‘Office’. After all, it’s nigh impossible for a no-name Fixer to take jobs on their own. Choosing the right Office is also important, but you can worry about that later. Only the skilled ones can afford to make choices, like decline offers from Offices or ask to be transferred to another. Newcomers who’ve only just become Fixers or incompetent planks who can’t handle their work properly should be content with any Office that accepts them.
After completing the day, Hokma will reward the player with permanent upgrades: The maximum limit upon all employee  statistics is now elevated to 130. When contracting a new employee, their  stats can now be fortified to 130, and the relevant department ( Record Team) will no longer be affected by Qliphoth Meltdowns.
After each Qliphoth Meltdown: All employees in the facility are  healed to their Max  HP and  SP. Employees still cannot be  healed from any other sources, even Main Rooms, except from Army in Black.
After each Qliphoth Meltdown: The boosted type of damage is changed.
After finishing the second mission, Hokma appears once again by saying that A might believe he doesn't know what happens in the facility, but explaining that it is the other way: That A doesn't know. Pain, agony, regrets, and the shadow of the past- referring to the original employees of Lobotomy- that has spent time with A is no match to their time together, as they didn't know him. Those who couldn't accept their fate tried to escape, like an employee who broke himself whenever executing order "Redacted". Unnecessary emotions are unfavorable, said by Hokma.
After losing 1/3 of her Max  HP (i.e. 1000) she will perform the Gold Rush attack used in Phase 1. This attack occurs twice in Phase 3.
After losing 1/3 of her Max  HP (i.e. 1000), The Red Mist will throw Da Capo to another Main Room, the weapon dealing 145-155  White damage to anyone in the way. The Red Mist will then ready Mimicry, the blade noticeably growing size, before dashing to that room through the facility, dealing 100 Red damage to anyone in the way, and slamming the enlarged Mimicry into the room, which will deal 450-500 Red Damage to all entities in the room. The Red Mist will then return to her normal attacking pattern. This attack occurs twice in Phase 2.
Aftermath
Again. Again. Again.
Age	Unknown
Ah, there’s one way to achieve that pipe dream. A Fixer’s freedom is only truly complete when they are given a color from the Hana Association. Don’t go around proclaiming that you’ll become one of the ‘Colors’, though. You think it’s that easy to break free from these massive fetters?

Alias(es)	Benjamin (Formerly)
All Your Powers Combined: The Head seemingly has access to the Singularity of every other Wing, with their agents utilizing weaponized versions of said Singularities. For example, the only known example of a live Claw in action, Baral, uses Serum W, Serum K and Serum R as liquid injections to supplement his already fierce combat prowess, while Arbiters use Singularities F and J outside of their main purpose as what could be mistaken for blasts of magic.
All deeds require the same resolve to pull oneself through.
All locations in Library of Ruina.
All of us are simply performing our duties.
All three of these Abnormalities are associated with objects from or are representative of mythology, which is where the speculation that M stands for Mythical stems from.
Allegorical Character: The Head is essentially an allegory of systemic oppression in and of itself, specifically its toxic maintenance of the status quo and the inability for the common person to rebel against it. Unlike a simple authoritarian regime, the Head doesn't NEED to wave its stick around and minutely control everything in the City - they simply uphold their personal laws and maintain the system, because that's all they need to do to keep the cycle of hurting going.

Along with it spawning and summoning the Meltdowns, it will also raise dark spikes below the agents of the other departments, dealing great  Black Damage (33-40) to anyone standing on its position, but it takes a short time to trigger.
Alphabetical Theme Naming: From A, B, and C Corp. all the way to Z Corp.
Also known as "The One Who Grips", Kromer is the leader of the fanatical N Corp. Inquisition, a group of N Corp. agents styled after the Knight Templar and the Inquisition.
Also known as the "Eyes of the World", is one of the two Wings directly affiliated with the Head. They appear to create regulations for fellow Wings, and manages their qualifications and shutdowns. They are also responsible for collecting taxes and ensuring everyone that lives in the City has to pay them, regardless of where or who they are. Their employees are called Beholders.
Also known as the "Head of the World", A Corp. is the 1st Wing, leader of the Wings, and a mysterious corporation that controls all the districts and resides in District 1 which is the center of the City and has the highest security. They hold the City with an iron fist through an unholy combination of greed, human suffering, and outright weirdness. Resistance against the Head is virtually impossible, and those who find out their true identity or plan any resistances against them, more often than not vanish and never return. Their basic functions include patenting singularities and creating/enforcing city-wide laws, but many of their regulations are eccentric at best and maliciously implemented at worst. To top it all off, they charge huge sums of taxes over almost everything.
Also known as the Claw, they are one of the two Wings directly affiliated with the Head. They are responsible for maintaining the shock troops named Claws, deployed to kill individuals guilty of various offenses instead of Wings. Executioners were used to refer to high rank Claws, and are signified by an extra trenchcoat. Just like the Arbiters directly from the Head, these agents spell certain doom for the offender. They might also accompany Arbiters against foes that could actually threaten them.
Alternatively, the Abnormality is dependent on the perception of others, desiring to obtain a proper form or identity through observing or being observed by human beings, and/or being denied personhood (ex. Nothing There).
Although not all Wings are named thus far, the 26 Wings appear to have an alphabetical name theme, with the number of the District they control corresponding to the position of their naming letter in the English alphabet.
Amazon Brigade: Every known Arbiter (all two of them) is female.
Ambiguity detected; response may be unreliable.
Ambiguous Situation:
Ambiguous Situation: The Mao Branch have some kind of connection to the R Corp. Rabbit Team, another hare-themed organization under the employ of a Wing. According to [Heishou Pack - Mao Branch] Ryōshū, they share the same origins but otherwise "have grazed on different grass". They even both share the combat gimmick of raising their speed to trigger conditionals based on the speed difference between them and a target.
Ambiguously Related: She's eerily similar to Binah/Garion, right down to having the same occupation, general personality, and even hair color, but it's ultimately unclear if all Arbiters are like this or if she and Garion are actually related somehow since these are the only two Arbiters shown on-screen.
Among the more intelligent ones, communication is possible with some Abnormalities, but interaction inherently poses danger due to their volatile personalities and abilities. Abnormalities typically possess an orange-and-blue morality, with their values being centered on the concept they embody. Due to the strange strands of logic that Abnormalities fundamentally follow—along with their dangerous, anomalous capabilities—this renders conventional reason and judgement irrelevant and brings great risk of death to those encountering them.
An Arbiter has  2400 HP instead of  4000 HP, 40% less than the original.
An Arbiter will have a 60 second to 75 second timer after the Meltdowns are cleared, and when that time is up, she has a 25% chance of re-adding the Meltdowns of Pillars or adding the Meltdowns of Dark Fog, Gold and Waves, repeating this until her  HP is reduced to 0.
An Arbiter, will appear from its main room and will roam through the facility with a yellow aura, trying to get into the upper departments. Its defenses start at Resistant (0.1) against  all types of damage.

An associate Office is one that is in a cooperative relationship with one of the Associations. The advantage of this designation is that its Fixers will not have to worry about starving, since they’re paid a stable salary… And that the Office simply has to handle tasks given by the Association with proficiency, rather than having to deal with clients and accept their requests as ordinary Offices do. Spending days without any incident happening in the area designated for peacekeeping can be admittedly boring… Though it’s a blessing to have such a peaceful day in the City. I was grateful to have such serenity each day, reasoning with Lulu’s occasional complaints.
An organization that works from the Backstreets of District 8, they are a mysterious cabal of shadowy mercenaries that are contractually bound to the lords of H. Corp. There are 12 branches, each corresponding to one animal in the Chinese Zodiac. They show absolute fealty to their lords, but to the position rather than the individual; they will switch allegiance on a dime should their "leash" be handed to a new master.
An ‘abnormality’ refers to an abnormal trait or occurrence; the term is usually used in a medical context.
Anachronism Stew: Its Nest architecture and its culture heavily resemble Industrial Revolution England, in a futuristic dystopian setting. Fitting a Wing revolving around time itself.
Anachronism Stew: The bizarre and diverse range of cultures and tech means that some Wings can have a rather specific aesthetic in both architecture and philosophies, which results in the highly advanced yet still grounded L Corp being neighbors with K Corp, a Wing that values technological growth so much that it's revolutionized robot development and outfits their elite personnel with what may as well be Powered Armor, who then have a business deal with N Corp, a Wing whose extremists can be considered luddites and fashion themselves in archaic armor reminiscent of The Crusades launched in medieval times, with said business deal giving the N Corp agents permission to assault and raze one of K Corps' villages, which has kept its medieval-German roots. Likewise, this also means that weapons between each Wing and Fixer vary wildly, with various mercenaries and enforcers using weapons that harken back to old-century weapons if they were forged in the modern day such as halberds, war hammers and lances, while others use firearms that look like they were made in the modern age, such as 9mm pistols, while others such as R Corp use obviously advanced and futuristic assault rifles.
And Your Reward Is Clothes: Kill her using Gebura in the final Act of R Corp. II, and Gebura gets a unique Battle Symbol in the form of rabbit ears to wear.
And how do you get the money for that? Duh, you’re supposed to earn it, isn’t that obvious? …Funny, isn’t it. You jump into the Fixer business trying to earn money, but you need to get into debt and spend money to be able to do proper work. How ironic is that? This world’s one giant hamster wheel.
And in the many worlds I’ve been to while doing this job… I saw many people who were lost after losing their precious stuff, just like me. I couldn’t just pass them by. They looked so miserable and pitiful. Well… It wasn’t entirely out of goodwill. The fact that they were worth helping played a big part. Once again, nothing in this world is free. I didn’t quite pity them as much as I weighed up the favors they could give me in return. Thanks to that, I’ve become acquainted with quite a few Fixers… And as corny as it is to say this myself, some even started calling me their mentor, and became my devoted admirers.
And now they’ve been trying to invade our territory, desperate to loot anything.
And she was right; a huge war broke out soon after. Thick smoke covered that Nest.
And some Fixers often cooperate with Syndicates to handle cases. Y’know, it’s not like dogs and cats constantly fight each other when they’re together, yeah? That sorta logic. We Syndicates do the things Fixers can’t dare take care of. I heard some Offices straight up ban killing people, even. Something about life being precious and whatevs. It’s bullcrap. Anyway, that’s how Syndicates and Fixers complement each other. There’s some crooks you’d want dead for sure before they could complicate things, you see?
And the Fixers at Clam Office that were cooperating with them from the back are gone, too…
And they said, they did try to request an Office at first with the money raised by their neighbors. But then the Office asked for a ridiculous sum of money, claiming that there’s much preparation they need to take before they can uproot a whole Syndicate. Poor fellow begged for help, but the Office personnel didn’t even flinch. Well, money is the only thing that gets Fixers moving, so that’s understandable. And I think their friend recommended us to them while they were looking for another way, if I remember it right? Introduced us as a trustworthy Syndicate. So they came all the way to our hideout.
Angela
Angela (Moments before retreating): "You sure are verbose company, just like Binah."note
Angela - Roland - Malkuth - Yesod - Hod - Netzach - Tiphereth - Gebura - Chesed - Binah - Hokma
Angela admits her uncertainty as to the reason. She states that she and the Sephirot are creations of the Light, and therefore cannot exist outside of the Library. She expresses her wish to break free of this shackle, noting that there can only be two outcomes: either they will receive a new life, or perish.
Angela asks if Hokma is implying that she cannot escape from Carmen. Hokma replies that, though she is a copy of Carmen, she cannot ever be the same being as her. Angela muses that Carmen’s life was ingrained into her head in the form of pure knowledge, rather than memories. She expresses her desire to break free of Carmen, but fears that she will be utterly alone if she does. Hokma posits that others may be willing to remain at her side after she has disentangled herself from Carmen. Surprised, Angela asks who these people would be, only for Hokma to state that this is something they cannot know at this time.
Angela asks if Hokma remembers their successful completion of the “script” (referring to the Seed of Light scenario). Hokma confirms that he might, since the Sephirot’s memories are being filled by the books—but, as distinct beings from their original selves, they may not be able to celebrate this victory in its totality. He asks Angela what has become of Lobotomy Corporation, along with its employees and Abnormalities. Angela speculates that the facility was probably sealed underground, with some—though not all—of its residents surviving.
Angela betrays L corp and takes the light for herself
Angela bristles at this, interpreting it as the Sephirot taking pity on her. Hokma offers an alternative perspective: each of them is coming to understand her for different reasons. Still indignant, Angela claims that this is just pity wrapped in “fancy words.
Angela expresses her hatred for the Sephirot, claiming that she wanted nothing more than to erase them all, only for Carmen to convince her otherwise. Hokma does not believe this to be true—he states that it is Angela’s own will, rather than Carmen’s, that ultimately drove her to preserve the lives of both the Library’s Sephirot and its guests.
Angela gains ego and builds the library
Angela is surprised that Hokma is being gracious toward her after all of this, though he responds that it is up to her to interpret his feelings. He notes the irony of he and Ayin irresponsibly granting her life, only for her to be attempting an irresponsible bestowal of life upon the Library’s inhabitants in return. Angela believes that, regardless of what he says, he will still try to stop her. Hokma responds that this depends on her decision—until then, he will trust her and wait patiently.
Angela makes to leave, seeing no use in staying if Hokma won’t answer her questions. Calling her harsh, he asks whether or not she wishes to have a conversation. He claims there is only one answer to her question: everything she has done—from constructing the Library to sending out invitations—was accomplished via utilization of the Light, which she has been collecting in accordance with someone else’s instructions. Despite her wish to move onward, she has only been able to progress through a single person’s guidance: Carmen, the woman she was made to replace. It is by Carmen’s will and interpretations that guests are invited to enter and therefore grow the Library. Hokma remarks that Angela must have noticed this to some extent, and finds it strange that she has retained so much faith in the invitations in spite of it.
Angela once tried to automate hope. The result was... mixed.
Angela once tried to automate suppression. The alarms are still ringing.
Angela ponders whether she has truly wished for vengeance all this time. She wonders if she could be forgiven for seeing this path through to its end, and if anyone would still be at her side by that point. No matter how much she read, however, she always reached the same conclusion. She ultimately resolves to push through with her quest for the “one true book”, since said desire was instilled by Carmen—the only person to remain by her side this entire time.
Angela says E.G.O is ‘Extermination of Geometrical Organ.’ I say it’s ‘Extremely Grumpy Object.’
Angela says I anthropomorphize them too much. I say she’s just jealous.
Angela says I’m too dramatic, but have you met Gebura?
Angela says laughter is the best medicine. I say containment is safer.
Angela says the Sephirot are the backbone of the facility. I say we’re the coffee supply.
Angela shortly takes her leave. Chesed offers for her to visit his floor later, saying that she can bring Roland if she wants, since he also frequently visits. Hod wonders if Angela will visit them again later; Chesed believes so.
Animal Motifs: The entire system is symbolically compared to a multi-winged bird, with the Head, Eye and Claw forming the basic, most important and fundamental functions of the body and the Wings existing to support that body, each and every Singularity compared to an egg the bird nurtures, and each individual person living in a Nest is compared to one of many feathers on the Wings.

Any advice for dealing with loss?
Any tips for handling anxiety?
Anyways, since I was asked to pay a visit to the Library… It’ll be worth investigating the case some more after I get this job done.
Apart from direct extraction methods, Abnormalities can also provide trinkets or even their own body parts to employees they fancy. These presents are collectively known as E.G.O Gifts (E.G.O 기프트, E.G.O Gipeuteu), and will either permanently integrate into the employee’s anatomy or form an attachment with the Agent that makes them reluctant to cast the gift off. Though E.G.O Gifts are of a lesser degree than regular E.G.O Equipment, they are still a part of the egos of the Abnormalities they originated from, and carry the same risk of mental deterioration if too many Gifts are taken by an Agent.

Argalia. Alias: The Blue Reverberation. The person who is known to furtively cause incidents. Recently, he is suspected of recruiting individuals wielding powers that are possibly related to the Distortion Phenomenon in an attempt to form an organization. As well as prying into his plots, I intend to hamper his efforts myself before collecting data and presenting evidence of his irregular activity to the Head. As the Blue Reverberation’s plot was already in motion, I needed to act quick and do the least I could to stop him. However, Shi Association was too fatigued from the barrage of requests, so I asked Full-Stop Office to deal with the Church of Gears, whose leader seemed to harness a power that resembles the Distortion. But I haven’t heard from them since. Perhaps they were eliminated in their mission at the hands of the Church… Or, if the Blue Reverberation expected the Fixers’ arrival and toyed with them, then I will definitely have to get to the Library and read their books. There was evident rationale to read the books of the Musicians of Bremen as well, for they could contain even the slightest hint on the Blue Reverberation’s plots he might have told them. Even I do not know the man in detail, admittedly. However, because I am certain that the Blue Reverberation is conspiring something that violates or will violate the rules stipulated by the Head, I must gather crucial evidence and report it.

As before, The Red Mist will stay in the room she is in, engaging entities that enter the room. As she has new weapons, her attacks have changed.
As her friend, it’s unfortunate that Lulu is struck with grief. I don’t have any tears to shed for her, though. I’ve got my share of rough experiences, I’m just not sharing it with others. Well, I did say I’ll help her out, but the truth is… My Office figured that we could find plenty of valuable loot in the Library. And that’s pretty tempting. The other one is probably thinking the same thing as me. I mean, what dummy would actually head to such a dangerous place motivated purely by a friend’s sob story? That kind of intimate and deep relationship is long gone from this world. Especially in this business.
As it turns out, the true nature of the healing serum is its ability to return living things to their original state. The healing bullets are refined and modified to limit its abilities and make it interpret the original state as a healthy human body (as that's what the user would think), but it can be modified to forcibly mutate or regress organisms instead by altering the target's perception of what their "original" state is. If the serum is not refined and given a suggestion beforehand, it will instead revert things back into the "purest forms" of themselves, which is unknown but will almost certainly result in instant death for any living being that touches it.
As long as we are chained to our lives, we ought to live.
As more time passed, I could use the armor for longer, and eventually got to draw out its full power. I had a weapon and armor that resonate with my emotions. Using them, I could protect more people, and I was able to draw forth more durability and strength. The researchers seemed to be struggling to make progress with their work, but it was alright. I believed in them to make it through, and I just had to be quicker to do my job in the meantime. However, not long after, the incident happened all too suddenly. No, maybe it wasn’t so sudden. The sign was there.
As much as it’s necessary to choose the right attire according to the code, the most important factor is the fabric that clothing is made of. Quality fabric can offer better protection, lighten the wearer’s weight for quicker movement, or allow the wearer to carry heavy weapons as large as their body. Those who create and provide such fabric are called ‘Tailors’.
As my thoughts became clearer, I couldn’t just sit down. My body acted before my head could decide what to do. I don’t exactly remember what happened then. When I finally took a grip on my rationality in a vast mindscape and came back to my senses, my body was burning hot. Is this rage? Have I been taken over to the point where I can’t even see ahead? But I felt so calm, refreshed even. My head was kept cool, while my heart leading the body was aflame. It wasn’t long until I felt that something was different. On solid armor, there was a layer of something tough and dense, but it wasn’t fabric… A veil of mist was covering me. Astonished, I moved around and shook my limbs several times, and the veil dissipated soon after.
As of Intervallo I, its District remains unclaimed.[3]
As per tradition, both Ryoshu and Don have these in their W Corp Identities - with Don losing HP if she uses her third skill when below 10 charge, and Ryoshu being guaranteed to lose HP if she ever uses her third skill when below 15 charge. Luckily, the latter has an indicator of when she can use it safely.
As seen in The Distortion Detective, Dias used the Smoke War to eliminate her enemies. Moses, the Captain of the Udjat at the time, participated in these killings, suppressing her doubts to support Dias' will. However, these acts caused Moses to gradually lose her faith in Dias, and she realized Dias was merely using her and the rest of the Udjat as disposable tools. At some point during the war, Moses chose to quit the Udjat while in L Corp's Nest, vowing to bring her subordinates Ezra and Han Hee-joon out of the organization as well.[10][4] According to Hee-joon, Moses then went on a rampage which left only him and Ezra alive.[11]
Ascended Extra: The Claw only appears as Ordeals in Lobotomy Corporation, and the Post-Final Boss confrontation against the Head is the first time we saw a real one in action. Needless to say, he is not fit for a heavily fatigued Library to deal with.

Associate Fixers are classified into multiple levels, too. From Section 1, which is the apex, to Section 6, the bottom… There’s a world of difference in the salaries and treatment they get.

At first, people at this corp also struggled to think of a good way to use this tech. Even if it could make a big rip in space, entering it was a whole different matter; you don’t know what’s in there or if you can even come back… They had no idea. But soon enough, W Corp. found a way to put this dimensional gate to use, which involves T Corp’s technology. With the device made by T Corp. that collects time installed in the train, not a single second really "passes" in the carriages even if the train travels for thousands of years. It’s the, uhh… temporal preservation or whatever. That’s what they apparently use, but it’s too complicated for me. Anyway, whatever happens in the train, we revert it using our Singularity of restoration, and T Corp. takes the time we collect for their own Singularity. We’re good business partners.
At the end of the day people just laughed it off, talking about how nonsensical their hypotheses were and how secretive Singularities are. Maybe they had the right answer, though they missed the mark a bit.
At the last phase: the player can pause (Hokma Suppression effect will kill/panic random employees).
At the same time, it is not uncommon for Wings to form partnerships and exchange supplies, personnel, and more, especially when a Wing's goods or services are not easily replicated or utilized by others. For example, L Corp. supplied energy to multiple other Wings, and had a particular relationship with two other Wings, W Corp and R Corp. R Corp. provided security for the Wings' Nests, W Corp. provided transportation services for its partners, and L Corp. supplied its partners with energy.[19]

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever: In Gregor's flashback in Chapter 1 of Limbus, one of the insectoid beasts is a lanky and towering insect that nominally looks humanoid overlooking a skyscraper. How accurate this actually is is up for debate, especially since the sheer destructive scale of the thing would likely raise some eyebrows from the Head's weapon and property damage laws, but the implication that G Corp. had freakishly large units in their ground armies is still present.

Avoidance breeds ignorance; suppression breeds growth, though it is painful."
Awesome, but Impractical: His unique passive, Survivor, grants him 1 Strength and Endurance for the rest of act every time he gets staggered and can stack up to 5 times. Getting him to activate his passive even once, much less five times, in a single act without dying once he gets staggered, however, is nearly impossible at the point of the game where you get this passive.
Ax-Crazy: Every single member is bat-shit insane and impossible to reason with - this is implied to be enforced through essentially drugging the potential grunt through their food and then brainwashing them.

Quite the reverse, they would seemingly sacrifice profit, efficiency, or any sort of common sense whatsoever to maximize the number of dead bodies and suffering people amongst their quarters.

Back in the present, Angela has manifested the Plague Doctor’s form. She admits that she is scared: if she embraces her past and moves beyond it, what will she have left? Up until this point, she has clung to the memories of her sufferings and subsequent desire for vengeance, and fears that there will be nothing left for her if she overcomes this. Hokma responds that, no matter how agonizing it is, she must accept the death of the past and move onward toward the future. He remarks that he, too, was chained to the past before he came to this revelation. He states that Angela may feel confused at the moment, but will come to understand soon enough.
Back when I was a young kid, I didn’t like that. I thought I was better than those Rats. So I decided to get into an examinee town. Little did I know that it’d be the one choice I’d regret the most… I begged and nagged at my parents, wanting to achieve that stupid dream. How’d it go, you ask? Seems you’re just as stupid, aren’t you. I wouldn’t be hanging out with these folks if I made it, now would I?
Back when we were still part of the killer Syndicate, we got a client asking us to hunt some crazed Syndicate. They were shaking like a drenched rat as they came in. I suppose they were scared of places like this. They asked us to catch the wicked criminals kidnapping people in the parts of the streets they live in. We had one question, though; it’s nice that they’re giving us a job, but why ask a Syndicate like ours instead of going to the Zwei or other Offices that are better suited for handling public safety issues?
Backstreets
Backstreets Butchers • Hook Office Remnants • Urban Myth-class Syndicate
Backstreets are spread all over the City, and the Nests are no exception. But all this means is that “there are Backstreets in the Nests”, since the Nests are completely segregated from the Backstreets in terms of access. Each Wing employs their own methods like electric fences or plasma walls, and some just fence the boundary with a couple of loose chains. Needless to say, the Backstreet residents don’t even think about crossing the border, regardless of how insecure it looks.

Basically speaking, people who visit our Office are looking for shrewd and precise situational assessment rather than combat prowess. The ability to make quick calculations for various possible scenarios and neutralize or kill the enemy with the least effort. We are hunters of the City. We Wedge pierce the requests we get with swiftness and precision.

Because Enkephalin was highly valuable as an efficient fuel source and was advertised as an eco-friendly form of energy, L Corp’s status as a Wing was elevated far above its peers and cemented the megacorp as a major power within the City.
Because grief is the echo of love that can no longer find its home.
Because of that, Tailors who make high-quality fabric usually belong to an organization and create cloth exclusively for them. But we were different. Until the Index gave us a Prescript, we did our work without taking orders from anyone, unchained to any Syndicate or other organization. We were free, as some may call it.
Because of this, and the fact that Abnormalities are immortal beings that can never die, there is no point in resenting or hating them. They can never be permanently destroyed, so upon breaching containment and running amok, suppressing the Abnormality and re-containing it is the only option one is left with.
Bedlam House: 'Limbus Company' briefly references them running an "Abyss Trauma Correctional Facility", which people can apparently be forcibly committed to.
Before Lobotomy Corporation discovered Cogito and began mass-producing Abnormalities, these kinds of entities were one of the numerous types of ‘monsters’ (괴물, goemul) native to the Outskirts and Ruins—the wastelands beyond the safety of the City.
Before fighting the Hana Association's section 3, their agents discuss how the Head was doing literally nothing even when the whole Reverberation Ensemble was camped next to the Library waiting to take its light to turn everyone into Distortions while casually slaughtering a bunch of Hana's Section 1 agents and a Color Fixer, and it's implied that said Ensemble wishes to turn their agents into Distortions as well. One might think that they would had been attacked instantly since the Ensemble was plotting a bare-faced rebellion against them, but they obviously didn't care about it. It turns out it's because they really don't, and the only situations where they attack is when someone commits specific types of seemingly trivial offenses (at least when compared to senseless mass slaughter) or when they are explicitly threatened.
Before the Library
Behavior
Behaviors are affected by various factors and situations—especially via the manager’s choices—and cause long-term and significant consequences.
Being an organization that is familiar with dealing death, the Shi’s code of honor is to treat every person equally, as the weight of death is equal for everyone. As long as the request fee is paid, we remove the target with no questions asked, regardless of who the client is, what kind of crime they may have committed, or any other details. The boss of a Syndicate known for murdering people in cold blood, a criminal wanted by a street somewhere, laundering an identity for a person of higher status who often bribes, even requests to kill one’s own friends and family… We handle all requests without leaning to a side. Of course, we have a duty of confidentiality to uphold for our clients. We mustn’t give in and maintain silence even in the face of immediate threats of death. Such are the rules and mindsets that the Shi Association’s members must abide by.
Being cognitive beings made manifest into the current reality, Abnormalities are entities representing various concepts born from the human mind. Ranging from human fears, complexes, and desires, these phantoms can be considered a different form of humanity and an existence considered as “human” as mankind itself.
Benjamin and Ayin start the smoke war to take down the old L corp. Ayin and Benjamin got K, I, T and the udjats who then roped in R to ally against old L corp. And old L corp had old G corp (and someone else) backing them up.
Berserk Button:
Berserk Button: Each Wing has a set of laws called Taboos that, if broken, will lead to immediate punishment and death for the individual. Notably, the Taboos are always in effect, even during the Night of the Backstreets. They go from ruthless, yet practical (U Corp outlawing the unauthorized recording the Laws of the Great Lake in order to maintain their monopoly) to the outright insane (N Corp outlawing any sort of filming).
Berserk Button: The Head seldom intervenes unless you happen to tick one of their oddly specific taboos, after which they will exterminate you with extreme prejudice. These taboos range from oddly mundane to almost nonsensical, ranging from tax evasion, patent fraud, disobeying gun control and cloning regulations (despite them almost intentionally being easy to work around), and creating sapient A.I., the last of which seems to be top of the list considering they sent multiple Arbiters and Claws after Angela and her creators on two separate occasions, one time before she was even made.
Berserk Button: U Corp has a major Taboo on writing down any of the laws of the Great Lake anywhere. Just going as far as scribbling down the Laws on a notebook is liable for them to send a Taboo Hunter on you - even though knowing the Laws is vital for navigating the Great Lake itself, forcing sailors to mentally remember them and spread information orally. The reasons for this taboo are actually far more mundane than they seem - U Corp sells encrypted information of the Lake's laws to large vessels like ones owned by other Wings, such as Lobotomy Corp's sea branch, and is presumably a pretty hefty part of their profit margin. Having people going around spreading information on the Laws by writing them down devalues this service of theirs severely.
Besides, the uhh… ‘The Eight Chefs’? For them, human meat is the one and only ingredient that matches their pursuit. Some buzz about how the process of cooking should be part of the flavor… You can’t do that with any other meat. So you’d better watch it. If you dare wander this part of the town, your destination might end up being a dining table.
Big Brother Is Watching: The Eye is nearly omnipotent and could seemingly spy on almost anywhere, including inside buildings without being physically present. Any misconduct considered capital offenses by the Head detected by them will be used to signal Arbiters and Claws to take out the offender(s).
Bigger on the Inside: As a result of their spatial manipulation, structures and containers designed by P Corp. have a tendency to be much larger on the inside than on the outside. Among other buyers, Devyat Association makes use of this technology for their Courier Trunks.
Binah (Right after saving Gebura and Roland): "It is indeed true that verbosity leaves you vulnerable.
Binah Meltdown
Binah's Core Suppression is available after Day 41. All the middle layer (Briah) must have been defeated first before triggering its event.

Blade Lineage isn’t known for coordination. It’s little more than a cohort of people who have nowhere else to go, or those who carry the intent to murder someone. Most who seek to join us sit at lowly social positions. It’s not rare for such people to hold a deadly grudge against someone. You’d best behave before those who are more skilled than you. We may be a band of murderous ruffians, but we understand our place.
Blah blah blah
Blood Knight: Zena expresses joy when she finds that despite being heavily weakened, Roland, Gebura, and Binah all still manage to put up a good fight and withstand her assaults, implying that, similarly to Garion, Zena relishes fighting powerful foes.
Bloodfiends. The beings said to have been punished with neverending thirst for the sin of lusting after human blood. That’s what your kind called us, condemning us out of fear. I was afraid as well when I faced them for the first time in that mansion where everything began. Violent beings who drank the blood of fellow humans. A growing feeling of unease about the possibility of being their next target. The people in the mansion were terrified of those who became monsters. Even though they were humans like us, they were outside of what we thought as the norm. In hindsight, though, it was such a silly thing to do. What is the illusion of normalcy that we feared for and fought for so strongly?
Blorp blorp blorp, what’s your reply?
Blue-and-Orange Morality: Some of these tend to go out of their way to be as cruel and nonsensical as possible for no known reason. For example, the Head will tolerate mass murder and cruel experiments to create monsters but they will instantly kill tax evaders on sight, and N Corp. is infamous for killing people and blowing up entire towns presumably as applications of their Singularities. Usually, the laws will make a twisted amount of sense when explained in full, but that requires getting into the personal morality of each Wing.
Blue-and-Orange Morality: They kill people over strange taboos and hate prosthetics for no apparent reason, making them some of the more logically alien Wings.
Body Horror: Their soldiers have this in spades thanks to being spliced with monstrous insects, sometimes being as simple as a sharp appendage replacing one limb, all the way to outright becoming a bipedal insect. An uncomfortable middle ground is the most common however, where people have most of their limbs converted into insect parts and have useless wings hanging off their back, or roach mandibles and carapaces jutting out of their face.
Boisterous Bruiser: Maxim, and by extension the rest the Rhino Team, are the loud, headstrong muscle of the R Corp mercenaries.

Businesses aligned with K Corp are afforded protections and resources to give the Wing's investment a reasonable chance of success.

But both Syndicates suddenly said they’re no longer selling ingredients for some reason. So now Pierre and I have to pioneer a new supply chain on our own. I don’t think this is all too bad, though. I enjoy working with Pierre a lot.
But in the end, I grew into an ordinary aspiring Fixer, and I learned that I was only an average person with no talent to show off. When I entered an ordinary Office with my ordinary capabilities, my mother seemed very glad to hear the news. She said an associate Office of the Zwei is a good start, and that I’ll certainly be able to become successful if I work my way up slowly. However, I was greatly disappointed in myself, and I couldn’t look my mother in the eyes until I said my final goodbyes and left the house.
But now… My body’s a machine as you can see. I can’t taste anything anymore. Thanks for pointing that out. Mo told me to stop dreaming about it. I still wanna try more delicious foods, though. Hot and flavorful… Spicy and sweet… Stuff like that. I guess this body is too cheap to restrain delusional thoughts like this. If we get more money and change our bodies to new ones… then maybe I’ll be able to stop these thoughts from getting in the way of my work?
But we’re humans, it’s just… something that can’t be helped. How could we just strictly detach ourselves from one another and focus on work? I tried acting nonchalant, I did, but… I guess I can’t do it. San said he feels the same. I gotta envy Mars for being cool-headed all the time.
But, I… well, yeah, I couldn’t tell her. Not just because I never saw the Red Mist again… or Gebura, as she is called now. We did meet each other after a long time, but that’s another story. I wouldn’t have been able to say it even if I met the Red Mist when she was alive and well. I got embarrassed of myself again. I thought I’d saved everyone, but after all, what I’ve been doing was far from being a hero.
But, man. Compared to us who have to wait indefinitely for someone to make a request… Lulu’s living a good life. At least she does something. And they don’t have to worry about starving to death even if they don’t get requests.
But, we aren’t totally powerless against those situations. We would’ve gotten into so many problems otherwise, yeah? In case things get too difficult for our agents to handle, we call R Corp, a Wing we’re partnered with. I saw footage about R Corp. in our training course… They were so cool. That was my first time seeing the mercenaries in action! They’d keep pressing on and wipe their targets, no matter how harsh their resistance was… I was like, whoa, they really are something else. The Fourth Pack… Was it called the Rabbit Team? Yeah, I think it was. I gotta wonder, though; why rabbits of all animals? Isn’t that an herbivore?
Butchering a human is a lot simpler than butchering other animals. Most of them are smaller than us. Which means we can subdue them right away even if they try to resist. Oh, I’m not saying you necessarily have to be tall to be a butcher, so don’t be discouraged. Anyway, humans can be a bit noisy, but they’re very handy to deal with overall since there’s little to worry about compared to other meats.

Cane Office
Cane Office	Chapter 1.4	1	 Book of WARP Cleanup Crew
Cane Office is a notary public Office that officially administers various matters when a contract is made between two Offices. A notary public Office preserves evidence involved in contractual processes and certifies legal issues. Sometimes, the Office may play the role of a broker.
Cane Office • R Corp. • R Corp. Ⅱ
CaneOfficeIcon
Capo dei capi (Godfather), Sottocapo (Underboss), Capo (Captain), and Soldato (Soldier/Goodfella)… The Thumb is divided into these four echelons. This hierarchical structure is still effective outside of the Syndicate. For example, a common Fixer is comparable to a Soldato, an Associate Fixer to a Capo, a board member of a Wing to a Sottocapo… This is how the hierarchy is to be interpreted. No outsider is exempt from this rule. No matter how you usually behave, you must remember your place and respect our rules when you’re dealing with the Thumb. If a young, oblivious Fixer walks up to a Capo and speaks to them, that poor picciotto will be rolling in the street the next day with his jaw and teeth missing. On the other hand, someone with the right level of authority or person of a higher class would be a different story. If a person on the same echelon as ours were to approach us, we’d gladly greet them and hear what they have to say with an open mind. Conversations with them are to be conducted with courtesy and decorum. Furthermore, if the person you’re dealing with stands on a higher echelon than yours… They must be treated with utmost devotion and delicacy. Such is the rule of ours, and the respect to their position. Don’t be too bitter over it. Indeed, class is earned, not given for free; it’s only right to give it the respect it deserves.
Carmen gives speeches about the disease of the mind and recruits people
Carmen is found in the bathtub by Ayin who tries to preserve her body
Carmen recruits Kali as a grade 2 and then recruits Daniel after kidnaping him by mistake
Carmen’s state worsened with each passing day, like a rusting nail. The sunny eyes of the woman who had brought us together were now cloudy, and she spoke less and less. Her voice was lifeless, and she had gotten so cold; it wouldn’t have come to anyone’s surprise if she died at any moment. She didn’t bother trying to look okay. I think it was better that way. Everyone in the laboratory felt constraint in her presence. They viewed Carmen in different ways. Reproachful looks of those resenting her for bringing them so far, only to let go of her responsibility. Concerned looks of those worried that something might happen to her. And I guess there were some who had no thoughts. The research went on quietly, but not for long.
Case Name: ‘Thousand Needles’
Case Report: Entity A-01, the first apparent source of the incident, was wandering the Backstreets of District 22 before swelling up and exploding. Numerous needles were dispersed upon the explosion, flying in all directions. The needles which stuck onto building walls caused the site of impact to melt and crack; when a human was struck with one of the needles, they were transformed into A-02, going through the same bizarre process of detonation A-01 did. The orange symbol on the nape of A-01’s neck was also found on the needles discharged from its body. When I arrived at the scene after taking the request, the bits of flesh scattered around the streets began to merge into one giant body using a brainstem focus resonator, becoming a 3-meter-tall (~10ft) mass that I will refer to as A-03. A-03 began throwing large needles, the length of which varied from 1 to 3 meters. Unlike the small needles fired from the explosion of A-01 or A-02 that could only leave small dents on building structures, the giant needles flung by A-03 caused buildings to helplessly melt. In addition, local residents who stared into the entity’s eyes or holes in its body soon produced a boiling sound before turning into A-02, so I had to forbid people from observing it closely.

If one o’ those officials try to take a dig at somethin’ that happened during the Night in the Backstreets, some scary fellas called the Claws go after ‘em… I hear the Night in the Backstreets is considered a whatsit time for doin’ whatchamacallit permitted by the Head? I’ve got no dang clue why they set a time like this when every soul ‘ere’s already frightened to the bone. No matter what folks say, the Night in the Backstreets starts at 3:13 and ends at 4:34, ne’er too early or late by a single second, every time~

Celebration of their memory can bring comfort alongside sorrow.
Certain Abnormalities can form sorts of pairs as well, due to embodying concepts or themes interconnected to one another; pairings like these vary from Symbiotic (such as Yin and Yang) to Hostile (such as Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary and Big and Will be Bad Wolf) and will usually cause havoc to the facility when interacting with one another.

Charles’ Office, the place Renaud worked, was popular among Fixers. It was the subject of a lot of gossip. For good reason, as it was a Grade 1 Office consisting of just a few elites, handling any request with ease… People would often wonder exactly what kind of Fixers were in that Office. All we know about the Office is that its Fixers wore luxurious clothes, and the Office interior was fancy as well—in a style unique to the northern side… And that there were twelve Fixers led by someone called the “captain”… and they’ve all parted ways now, living their own lives. That’s about it. Outside of Renaud, the person who helped us, we’ve only ever seen Maugris and Astolfo, who he would sometimes accompany… And someone called Bradamante. Their attire and weapons were all so distinct from what I could see of just those four, I couldn’t find anything in common. And the pressure I felt just from being around those powerful Fixers… The stark difference between me and them was something, I couldn’t think much else.

Chesed Meltdown
Chesed's Core Suppression is available after Day 36 if Gebura's fourth mission is completed. All Upper Layer (Asiyah) Suppressions must be completed first before triggering this event. During the Core Suppression, he takes the form of a cross, having a gray body with a cyan eye at center, and with the cross having triangle shaped tips, each one representing one of the  four damage types, from the top clockwise: Red, White, Black and Pale. Multiple arm-like black appendages come out from the central body, each holding part of Chesed's robotic hull, except for one which holds Chesed's Lobotomy Corporation coffee cup. Another cross appears at the top of the screen with letters written on each tip for each damage type: R, W, B, P.
Child Soldiers: They’re not above using teenagers for frontline combat, with Gregor noted to be at least 15 years old, possibly younger, when he was first spliced by researchers and trained for combat. His brothers in arms, particularly the young man who adores him as a hero, look no older than teens themselves.

City in a Bottle: Almost the entirety of H Corp. is a giant closed-off cube and the titular Hongyuan (lit. "vast garden"). The wealthier someone is the closer to the center they get to be, and the wealthiest are among a lavish garden in the very center, called the Daguanyuan (lit. "grand view garden"). All the buildings are packed together, and the architecture periodically shifts and restructures itself seemingly at random.
Claiming that she and the Sephirot never had any hopes of building a relationship, Angela recalls the towering pillars of books she collected for herself, to be read ceaselessly in a quest to find the knowledge that would set her free. She expresses her desire to start anew, begging whomever might be at her side to tell her where she should go. More than anything, she does not wish to be alone.

Cloth weaved from human silk possesses various powers depending on the human’s strengths. Some humans may have a strong body, another may be fragile but wise, and yet another may flaunt incredible speed. Since the silk reflects the characteristics of the human it was made from, there are as many forms and powers of cloth as there are humans in this world. Therefore, there is more to being a Tailor than simply weaving silk carefully. Picking the right people to meet the demands of the client is the most important. Hastily making silk out of a human that looks courageous on the outside might end up yielding useless cloth that does nothing but bolster courage, so one must be careful with picking the right material.
Cloudcuckoolander:
Cloudcuckoolander: Their behavior or decision-making processes generally don't make any sense whatsoever even from an economic perspective, most notably seen in the Head, W Corp, and L Corp. The Wings also have taboos that are grounded on execution once violated, which can be very nonsensical and minor such as "taking footage in N Corp's district".
Cloudy bastards… Why’re they picking at us so much? We’ve taken some serious damage on our side.
Codex
Collapse of Lobotomy Corporation
Collapsing Lair: Nests under the governance of a Wing are mostly stable metropolitan areas, but if the governing Wing falls, the entire Nest turns into a slum and is treated no different from the Backstreets where its residents are free game for Sweepers and Syndicates. Any employees formerly working in the fallen Wing will also be plunged into working for scraps unless they are deemed useful for another Wing. This is why A Corp's Nest is well-coveted by the rich according to Chesed, because it's near inconceivable for A Corp to fall (if it did, the City would be as good as destroyed).
Collusion
Colors are assigned by the ‘Hana Association’. They’re bundled into such a category because the Hana deemed them to be the most ideal Fixers. Because they’re the most adequate individuals to deal with the ‘Stars of the City’. The title of a Color is forcibly given to Fixers who qualify, essentially. Can a Fixer be truly happy with freedom that was forcefully handed to them?

Containment breach or coffee break? Sometimes, it’s hard to tell.
Containment first, comedy second.
Containment is an act of understanding, not just control.
Containment is not cruelty. It is both a shield for the world and a mirror for ourselves. The Abnormalities teach us, and sometimes, we teach them in return—even if the lessons are hard-won.
Containment: Abnormalities are contained in 'Containment Units', zones where they reside at the start of the day in passive states. The Containment Units are all the same. The Abnormalities contained are divided into the different departments available, usually housing 4 to 8 Abnormalities per Department in their units. At the start of most days, the player must choose one Abnormality to add to their facility, usually from a selection of 3.

Contracts should be signed on equal terms with the consent of all parties involved. And the Offices must fulfill the terms of the contract following the mutual agreement. It’s a societal boundary that keeps us humans from betraying each other’s trust as we must coexist. Although these principles are rather abstract, they exist to prevent anyone from devising lowly schemes and ensure that each party gets just benefits. The Head’s rules don’t cover every small detail, so you can say this is a necessary addition to fill those gaps.

Dark Secret: The carnage and horror you witnessed back in Love Town isn't a Singularity malfunction or accident; that is literally how the Trains they run work. The cleanup crew makes passing notes of notable incidents such as a Color Fixer smuggling himself into the regular class and trained the passengers on how to fight for 2,000 years, and sometimes things go so bad that they send the Rabbit Team against heavily mutated and insane passengers. W Corp is extremely cautious around this secret, which is only handled by a select few because they wipe the passenger's memories to make them feel like they passed 10 seconds in the train instead of 2,000 years.

Death
Death follows the trails of [Abnormality]’s escape. Please be careful.
Death or Glory Attack: Downplayed with the Secret Art of Rose, Lesti, and Sen, Rip Space. It uses up all of the charges that the crewmate has accumulated for a chance to deal two incredibly devastating attacks that can draw more pages, but it also has a chance to deal a massive 20 recoil damage to the user on failure. What makes this downplayed, however, is that each charge spent increases the chances of success by 9.9%; with the max charge amount being 10, the combat page can potentially have a 99% success rate on use.
Defector from Decadence: L Corp. is baffling among Wings for doing something with its power never before seen in the City - an act of selflessness, at least in the intention of the top management. Though the Seed of Light couldn’t be fully deployed, enough of its effects took hold that there’s at least a sporting chance for the cycle of violence in the City to someday end.

Department	Record
Depending on their type, their Observation Level and the way to get information about them is different. The main information unlocks its name, portrait, subject number and tool type. Logs unlocks entries and story related information and the Methods unlocks information about the Abnormality, like its effects and ways to use it.
Derived from ‘hwansang’ (환상, 幻想), meaning illusion or fantasy; the suffix -‘che’ (체, 體) implies the former to be a physical entity. Their names would’ve formed wordplay around “fantasy”, as exemplified with Adam’s monologue on Day 49 as seen below. If Abnormalities could have been given a more accurate localization, a title such as ‘fantasm’ or ‘fantoms’ would’ve been appropriate paronomasia.
Description
Description: This document is a compilation of relevant information on the case of the Thousand Needles, which occurred in the Backstreets of District 22. While a clear conclusion on this case has yet to be made, it is speculated to be a case of the Distortion based on the apparent inability to confirm the cause or analyze the composition.
Despair and paperwork arrive in the same envelope.
Despair can be overwhelming, but it is never the final word.
Despair grows in isolation; hope thrives in connection.
Despair is a shadow, but even shadows disappear in the light.
Despair is a teacher, but hope is the lesson.
Despair is not the end; it is a pause before the next beginning.
Despair is realizing the vending machine is out of snacks, again.
Despair is the shadow that gives hope its shape."
Despair may seem endless, especially after failure. But remember: every cycle is a chance to begin again. Those who persist through despair often become the strongest bearers of hope for others.
Despair sharpens the value of every joyful moment.
Despair, too, has its lessons. It teaches us humility, patience, and the value of even the smallest light.
Despite all that, people still inhabit the Backstreets. They doggedly struggle and survive in their own ways here.
Despite all this, there still are workshops that manufacture guns and people like us who use them. Guns are just that comfortable to use. Those heavy taxes won’t be a problem as long as use your gun for its intended purpose. How many defenseless thugs standing in the middle of the street can notice a bullet flying toward them? Of course, it’d be even better to get specially made workshop devices that use a special technology to muffle the sound of gunfire, but… Don’t expect too much. There’s currently no technology in our world that can completely cancel out noise, and it won’t exist in the foreseeable future. You don’t need that to make guns work, though. All it takes is an advantageous situation.
Despite there being 26 Wings, no corresponding "District 26" or "Nest Z" have appeared or been mentioned so far in any capacity.

Dialogue
Did you know? Many people whom insurance companies employ are those who have experience with detective work involving investigations and deduction. Since we deal with huge sums of money, there are more than a few cases where our clients deliberately harm themselves or lie to us in an attempt to commit insurance fraud. A considerable number of calls we get actually aren’t mere incidents. How do we tell apart a real accident from the fake ones, then? Haha, that’s a business secret. Well, maybe a little hint… Oftentimes, something will be off about the way they act or talk. I told you that folks who used to do detective work frequently jump over to our industry, right? Those armchair fellows certainly have their wits… Their keen eyes will catch the signs hidden in even the most elaborate of disguises. They say the terms can be a little too particular, but I disagree. When handling that much money, it doesn’t hurt to be thorough with inspecting and determining the validity of cases, right? If people started reaping insurance payouts for the smallest things, our business wouldn’t survive. You’d be surprised to learn how many people in the City still cling to the idea of get-rich-quick schemes.
Did you truly believe that there was clear benefit to be reapt from this battle.
Didja know? There’s grades for each alley in the Backstreets. Funny, ain’t it. Trash in a trash can are grading each other… The parts that’re under the protection of a Syndicate, Office, or Association are pretty safe. Sweepers can’t raid those streets easily. Putting the people who live there in a different grade from those who don’t, though… is pointless, honestly speaking. Sure, it’s a bit safer over there, but we’re talking about the Backstreets, get it?
Difficult times test our convictions, but they also offer us the opportunity to redefine ourselves.

Director Xiao liked to emphasize something: “A mercenary’s work is to deceive; to fool the enemy into believing that we are advancing when we defend; to make the enemy believe we will thrust from the front when we strike from above. Feign submission when you raise your claws; we must seem unable when able to attack, that the enemy may grow arrogant. When the enemy is roused, distract them through disturbance; be aware that we ourselves are not subject to such anger. In order to defeat the enemy, we must be roused to anger; to remember that one’s emotions must remain a means to motivate the body and not the ends, and to exploit the enemy’s wrath with this in mind.” Our director may be seized with anger and momentarily stray onto inadvisable paths sometimes, but even the whitest jade has a flaw; I trust her to set herself back on the right track in no time.
Dislikes
Distortions
Distortions (뒤틀림) are powerful, monstrous entities in the City whom are former humans who have been overcome by their emotions. The process by which humans Distort is referred to as the Distortion Phenomenon, and it has been graded as an Urban Nightmare-class threat, becoming the priority topic of investigation for many groups and individuals in the City, though individual Distortions are rarely graded higher than Urban Plague.
Distressed by the extremes Ayin was going to, Benjamin pleaded with him to stop, ultimately abandoning him when he refused. In actuality, Benjamin hid within Lobotomy Corporation and attempted to warn an amnesic Ayin about the truth behind the facility and Angela. The script, however, necessitated that Angela locate and kill Benjamin, turning him into the final Sephirah, Hokma.

Do I have to recall that messed up memory…? …Alright. If it’s necessary to prevent another incident from happening… I guess there’s no choice. You can record it, sure. I don’t remember everything that happened, actually. That day was just like any other, except Dery showed up in the streets after going missing for a few days, looking awfully gaunt… Other than that, the weather was normal, and the streets were the same as always. I know, that’s when the incident started… Dery was walking the street as they mumbled something, but they didn’t seem to be heading to a specific destination. It’s like they were staring off into space and forcibly dragging their feet along. They said strange things like something… keeps coming, or boiling; they were always a bit of a weirdo, so that didn’t bother me too much. But then… Dery’s body began swelling up. All I could think at that moment was how funny they looked, expanded like a balloon. The scene was that unrealistic. Maybe it was the shock of confronting an unbelievable situation paralyzing the human brain, or the brain beginning to believe that it’s only a dream and marveling at the scene, but I was just standing still and staring at what was going on. “Am I really in reality?” But before I could gather myself up, the incident happened. Dery’s body blew up and weird needles went. Mrs. Madrid, who was standing in front of me, was struck with one of the needles. And her body swelled up and exploded into a shower of needles, just like Dery did. I luckily managed to get away without getting hit by any needles. I ran right to this Office without turning back once… And now… Now… I don’t think I can get back there. I wonder if anyone else lived… If my friend Mijin’s alright… If my house is fine… I’m curious, but I just can’t go back—I can’t do it… What do I do… I don’t wanna go back to… (The interviewee’s breath became coarse and unstable afterwards; the recording was suspended as it was deemed that the interview could no longer proceed.)

Don’t just buy the things others recommend without doing your own research, though. That’s one of the stupidest things you could do. Might fit them, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have a good time with it. Still confident that you can wield ‘em well? Get real, buddy. Workshop equipment is not your average weaponry. So, before you choose your weapon, observe others carefully. See if any workshop products might suit you. Having keen eyes is all part of our skills. Guess why people choose us and our Office out of all the tough Fixers out there.
Down in the Dumps: In contrast to the borderline beach paradise of the Nest, the Backstreets of U Corp are horrifically dilapidated wastelands overflowing with trash and sewage, and crawling with various mutant creatures like the Trash Crabs. Naturally, Limbus Company has to go there in Intervallo 4.5 to get Mephistopheles some aquatic modifications.
Due to the often highly specialized nature of their Singularities, most Wings will try to use multiple Singularities in order to operate effectively. This often involves purchasing technology from other Wings, which can be an extremely expensive task. Because of this, it is common for Wings to compete with each other and even resort to methods such as corporate espionage and theft.
Due to their nature of essentially being Abnormalities stabilized into suits and weapons, those with weak minds and wills will risk having their egos consumed by E.G.O Equipment beyond their capabilities. Thus L Corp. only assigns E.G.O towards employees with appropriate levels of Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance, and/or Justice to avoid such risks.
During its event an old filter with small black marks or spots along the (now darker) corners will cover the screen during the day. A light glow occurs during certain Qliphoth Meltdown levels.
During its event, a filter similar to an old transmission will cover the screen. An expansive wave is emitted from the Sephirah upon reaching Qliphoth Meltdowns Level 2 and 4.
During its event, a green smoke or gas-like filter covers the screen during the day.
During its event, a static filter surrounds the borders of the screen. It covers the screen completely for a moment after the day starts and when reaching Qliphoth Meltdowns Level 2 and 4.
During the Core Suppression, the screen starts to lose color and enter grayscale after several Qliphoth Meltdowns. The screen will be completely covered by a static effect for a brief moment when the day starts and at Qliphoth Meltdown Level 7, 8, 9, and 10.
During the event, a rain overlay is displayed that covers the whole screen when beginning the Core Suppression and when advancing through certain segments of the Suppression.
During the event, dark corners and later on, a granulated effect covers the screen during the day.
During the event, it consists of the common effects said above and the inclusion of the Asiyah Sephirah bosses (Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach).
During their event, a green smoke or water-like filter surrounds the borders of the screen. This effect covers the screen completely for a moment after the day starts and again when reaching Qliphoth Meltdown Level 2 and 4.
During this event there will be no Ordeals nor Qliphoth Meltdowns. There is nothing majorly harmful on this day and the only thing that happens is visual facility effects. These effects are the following:
During this phase, An Arbiter will become Immune to damage and will charge pillars around itself in the cardinal directions, up to 8 pillars of  random damage types.

E.G.O
E.G.O Corrosion
E.G.O Equipment holds echoes of its origin; do not take them lightly.
E.G.O Gifts
E.G.O can amplify your virtues or your vices.
E.G.O can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your resolve.
E.G.O can erode the boundaries of self, blurring what is you and what is other."
E.G.O is more than a tool—it is a reflection of the Abnormality’s core, and a test of the user’s will. Gifts, too, are not simply rewards, but reminders of the bond—however tenuous—between humanity and the unknown. Every piece of E.G.O carries a story, and every Gift a lesson.
E.G.O is power, but also risk—respect what you wield.
E.G.O is proof that power and responsibility are inseparable.
E.G.O is the crystallization of a powerful idea—wielded, it can empower or consume."
E.G.O reveals as much about the user as about the Abnormality.
E.G.O seems to possess a will—a resonance with both user and origin."
E.G.O. Equipment: The E.G.O. Equipment is unlocked along, but not limited to, the Observation Levels of the Abnormality. There are 3 types of E.G.O. Equipment: Weapon, Suit and Gift. The equipment needs  PE-Boxes as a cost to be manufactured once unlocked, which then later can be equipped by Agents during the Deployment Phase to fight off and resist more bigger threats.
E.G.O. The weapon that corresponds to the mind of its wielder. The sword Carmen gave me was extracted from someone by chance. Giant eyeballs were attached to the sword adorned with crimson chunks of flesh; they watched my every move, almost to the point of making me feel a bit uncomfortable. Wondering if this was a product of some new Singularity, I asked Carmen what the thing was; she only said that I’ll have to get used to it, since there’s little she can do about how it looks. Although it looked a bit creepy, it wasn’t anything unbearable, and Carmen didn’t seem to mind it as long as there were experiments to be performed with it. She added that I have to be careful with it as it was thanks to sheer luck that the “E.G.O” could be extracted at all in its unstable state. I had a plethora of experience handling various workshop products, so I decided to take the sword without much hesitation.
E.G.O? Extremely Good Operator—or so Netzach wishes.

Each Abnormality is given a classification code following a Letter-XX-YY format:
Each Association has a creed or maxim that reflects its atmosphere. Some emphasize gallant passion, while others aspire to a quiet and cold attitude. The Hana Association is no exception in that it has a number of outwardly seen principles. Coincidentally, they represent the most basic ideas of the attitude a Fixer must have.
Each Sephirah carries a weight that cannot be shared.
Each Sephirah embodies both strength and regret, shaping their department."
Each Wing has its own cultural style and social structure which are reflected in how it governs its Nest, and the policies the Wing sets also determines the way of life in the District's Backstreet. Wings have differing degrees of presence, influence, and benevolence with regards to their Backstreets, although their relationship is ultimately exploitative, even for more cooperative Wings. Security of borders between Nests and Backstreets also vary from plasma walls to mere chain fences, but the Wings' power is such that no one in the Backstreets dares to cross over into a Nest without express permission.

Each department bears a unique story, colored by its Sephirah’s journey.
Each of the damage types is the same color of one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
Each of us uses different types of blades. Starting with the ranks of Messengers and Proxies, the Prescripts give personalized swords. From a light one-edged sword fit for slicing things quickly; to heavy, double-edged greatswords~ They come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Helps us stand out from each other. As for me, I’ve got five whole blades~ Maybe being speedy helped? It looks like we get swords that fit our traits~ Have you seen the sword Hubert’s carrying? It looks so heavy, and he swings it like it’s nothing.
Each time you face your fear, its power over you diminishes.

Etymology
Even Abnormalities know to avoid unnecessary risk.
Even I have limits, and you’ve found one.
Even a small spark of hope can illuminate the darkest path.
Even a trembling hand can hold a torch in the dark.
Even barring blatant violations of the AI Ethics Amendment such as Angela, copyright violations (such as the unauthorized creation of weapons out of patented Singularities), tax evasion and several other seemingly subsidiary offenses (at least when compared to uncontrolled manslaughter) are all grounds for the Head to deploy a Claw/Executioner or an Arbiter to pay a not-so-friendly visit to the offender's Workshop or Wing. At the very least these make some sort of sense: as the primary rulers of the City and the ones who hand out Patents, violations of those rules are a challenge to their authority. Although that doesn't explain how people and groups that directly want to challenge the Head are left free to do as they please, such as Argalia and Dias.
Even failed suppression can teach valuable lessons.
Even if it is impossible to move onward in this place, we must move nonetheless.
Even if you make your way up to the big leagues and become a decently influential Syndicate, there’s still loads of stronger gangs above ya, and they peck at you all the same. No matter how far a Syndicate climbs and tries, you just can’t surpass the Five Fingers at the top. Syndicates ain’t too different from Fixers in that you have to repeat the same, stupid shit following orders from above. So in my opinion, holding onto your place seems wiser than trying to climb up out of ambition or greed. Unless you’re at rock bottom, of course. Someone’s gotta be below us to serve as a punching bag, ain’t that right?
Even if your financial gain is on the higher side, you likely won’t earn enough to waste extravagantly. Meaning, you won’t get to take first class seats on WARP trains all the time or load the table with a sumptuous feast. However, it will be enough money to secure a stable life in the Nest. People who earn 4 million Ahn or more per month can be considered the upper middle class. That’s where the quality of life sees a visible increase. You no longer have to worry about being evicted from the Nest for being unable to pay taxes, and you can even hire Fixers to keep you safe. You can save up in case of emergencies, or send your children to better schools. A life lived in safe haven, free of illness and starvation. Well, that’s the life of an upper middle class they all talk about. What is there to be considered special? We just earn a bit more than others, and live in a bit more comfort than others.
Even in a powerful Syndicate, weaklings exist… Cowardice can surface among the strong, and chaos can ensue from the most faultless rules. Not everyone in the Thumb can abide the rules without a slip-up.
Even in defeat, hope can be found in the act of rising again.
Even in the darkest hours, a single act of courage can bring hope.
Even in the shadow of loss, kindness and compassion can flourish.
Even the longest night ends with dawn—so too will your fear pass.
Even the most monstrous Abnormality began as a single, fragile thought.
Even the strongest have moments of doubt; what matters is how you respond.
Even the wisest Sephirah needs counsel.
Even though there was danger in using it, its power was formidable; with it, I protected many a person, and cut down many a threat. The voice became stronger and deeper with the more blood the blade drank. One day, it asked a sharp question: “Don’t you desire a human shell as well?” When I think back on it, the question might not have been aimed at me specifically. It would only say whatever it wanted to say. It wouldn’t try to convince or allure me. All it uttered was monologue. Yet, I was frozen stiff when I heard that. It kept saying something. Are our lives really worth the blood I spilt for them? It wasn’t actually capable of forming such detailed sentences, but my head took it that way for some reason… Maybe I was thinking to myself.
Events
Eventually, a new Wing will rise to fill the gap left behind, and will be assigned the Nest by the Head. Once this happens, the new Wing will either buy the collapsed Nest from the holding Syndicate, or hire Fixers or other Syndicates to kick said holder out. The Nest will be slowly rebuilt under the new Wing's control, and life in the Nest will eventually return to normal. However, with the loss of their safety, the former feathers of the Nest generally do not have such a clean fate, and most will likely be forced to relocate, whether they try to find refuge in another Wing's Nest or simply join the population of the Backstreets.[10]

Ever heard of holdouts? When a Wing is broken, its Nest collapses and gradually turns into a slum akin to the Backstreets.
Ever since that day, I trained myself, aspiring to become like the hero that saved me that day; and landed a job at R Corp. I wanted to become a hero myself and save the lives of others… What I wanted more than anything, though, was to meet that person once more. R Corp. participated in most large battles in the City, so I expected to see her someday. I thought she’d have been alive all along since she was tough. I was going to thank her and show her how much stronger I had gotten since then if I did get to see her again.
Every Abnormality is a story written in pain, fear, or longing.
Every Abnormality may not have a reason to exist, but they all have a will to persist.
Every Gift is a message—sometimes clear, sometimes cryptic.
Every act of courage, no matter how small, matters.
Every choice is a stone cast into the river of time, shaping the current in subtle ways.
Every cycle in the facility is a chance for hope to return.
Every day you endure is a victory over your anxieties.
Every day you face fear, you add another brick to the fortress of your resolve.
Every ending leaves space for something new to grow.
Every new Abnormality brings new questions and new warnings.
Every person you admire has faced fear; it’s part of the journey.
Every small victory over fear builds your resilience for the next challenge.
Every suppression leaves a scar, seen or unseen.
Every team in the Fourth Pack has its own caricature. You’d think that we’ll never get along with each other, having such different personalities and powers and strengths, yeah? Surprisingly enough, we hunt in packs for most operations despite our differences.

Every team in the Fourth Pack has its own characteristics. Our personalities, powers, and strengths vary so greatly that it’s hard to imagine us working together… Nonetheless, we move in packs for most missions.
Every useful workshop technology is patented. The City strictly forbade making or selling products using technology patented by another workshop without purchasing the rights to it. If anyone infringes this regulation and still uses technology they shouldn’t have access to… They will receive a cease and desist letter up to three times. When you receive the warning, you must pay all profit you’ve earned through the infringement to A Corp. as a fine. Why A Corp. out of all places? Because that’s the corporate in charge of managing and granting all patents. It’s the Head we’re talking about. In any case, if you can’t pay the penalty by the third warning… The Claw will tear you down.
Everyone faces fear—acknowledging it is the first step to overcoming it.
Evil Counterpart: She's basically Binah back during her time as Garion, right down to having the same hair color and Psychotic Smirk. She's also just as verbose as Binah, as noted by Angela.
Evil Luddite: On top of their sheer brutality and backwards laws, it's implied that the Wing is at least partially technophobic, with camera and film technology being inexplicably banned and punishable by death if they're used in their territories. The team led by Kromer into K Corp. are particularly anti-prosthetic, hunting down and butchering anyone found using mechanical body parts for their crimes against the body, seeing it as an act of mercy to impale and burn heretics over letting them continue to suffer with their replacement parts. This is top of seeing the bus used by Limbus Company as a heretical vehicle and being willing to spare the entire team on the condition that they behead Dante on their behalf. Most petty of all, these Inquisitors have also smashed most of the electrical appliances in the village they're massacring with their nails save for the PA system. It goes some ways to explaining their preference for their archaic and crusader-themed uniforms, with the majority of the group's combatants wearing suits of armor with a modern flair. This makes them look out of this time period when put beside the more modernized Wings, and especially while inside the borders of the futuristic K Corp.
Evil Power Vacuum: Canto VIII reveals that during the brief transition period when a new Hierarch is to ascend the throne, all of the Heishou Packs that normally protect Hongyuan are fully neutral and on standby, leaving it up to the Hierarch-to-be's faction to protect them until they can formally claim the title and retake control. This makes it a good time for any prospective Wings, Syndicates, and other factions to try and seize the throne by force or implant their own proxy ruler, possibly starting a full-on War of the Wings. This exact situation ends up unfolding in Canto VIII, with factions like K Corp, N Corp, R Corp, X Corp, the Thumb, and more preparing to stage a hostile takeover in the aftermath of the Hierarch Evaluation, plus a rebellion of the Shi and Xue families backed by a Jia executive of Q Corp, and to make matters worse, Xichun's faction has been decimated so thoroughly that they lack the means to protect her until she can ascend the throne properly.
Examinee towns where people preparing for entrance exams in hopes of getting into a Nest have gathered; Syndicates and Fixers thirstily looking for business; workshops that benefit from their conflicts, crafting various tools and gadgets… It’s a disorderly lump of all kinds of desires for wealth and dreams.
Excludes humanoid collections of non-human objects (ex. Snow White’s Apple).
Experience Points: The flavor text of Mersault's N Corp. identity states that their Nails can be used to manufacture "canned experience". Vergillus's story also mentions them selling canned experiences that makes anyone who consumed them experience the feeling of committing suicide.

Fairy: It will charge an orb on its hand of a  random damage type and soon after, deal a wave of slashes in front of its position, reaching the end of the room. It deals great damage (220-300).
Fantasy Counterpart Culture: All of the known characters that come from S Corp's district have distinctly Korean names and are based on Korean historical figures, and it's described as a place in a tumultuous social and economic situation due to rampant corruption of higher-ups and officials, pulling a rather obvious parallel to real-life South Korea.
Fate Worse than Death: Suffered by one of its executive board members, who was a first-class passenger aboard the WARP Train hijacked by the Puppeteer, and turned into a Puppet. This is also the apparent fate of any humans consumed by a Whale of the Lake and turned into a Mermaid.
Fate and free will are intertwined, each shaping the other in unseen ways. We walk a path shaped by both our choices and forces beyond our control.
Fatigue and Waiting (Day 47)

Fear can guide you toward what matters most—listen carefully, but do not surrender.
Fear can unite us, for it is a feeling shared by all who strive for something meaningful.
Fear is natural; what you do in its presence defines you.
Fear is often the mind’s way of preparing you for change. Rather than resisting it, listen closely: what is it trying to protect? When you understand your fear, you can move forward with compassion for yourself, knowing that growth is rarely comfortable but always worthwhile.
Fear is the shadow cast by the unknown. It follows us through every corridor, whispering doubts. But remember: the light of your resolve can shrink that shadow. Here, in the heart of the facility, we all learn that facing fear is an act of quiet bravery. Allow yourself to feel, then choose to act.
Fear once kept me silent when I should have spoken. I regret the opportunities lost, but I have learned that every new day offers a chance to try again. The path to courage is not straight; it is made of many small, uncertain steps.
Fear reveals what matters most to us. It’s not a failing, but a signal. When you listen to your fear, you can use it as a compass, guiding you toward what you value and away from what would harm you. Let it teach you, but do not let it master you.

Few Fixers use guns for self-defense. Bullets cost an arm and a leg, and foes who are relatively powerful tend to dodge shots like it’s nothing, and I can barely graze ‘em… There’s not a lot of ways to react to enemies closing in, either. You’d have to be quick on the draw and shoot them in the weak spots; if you aren’t, the other options are running away or grabbing some prop to guard yourself… Like hell that’ll save you. It takes several augmentation procedures to be able to carry something as heavy as a firearm and run fast enough. If you’re a sniper, you’ll be busy packing up your weapon mount n’ everything; have to make unnecessarily big movements. And what if the precious gun gets damaged if you try blocking your foe’s attack with it? Oh, I was talking about the kinds of guns me and Tamaki use, not firearms in general. You see what Liwei’s carrying? I heard there are lighter rifles, and some that come with bayonets for close-quarters combat… But mind you, those guns have their fair share of downsides, so don’t be too quick to buy them. You might as well save the money and get a quality workshop weapon or an augmentation surgery instead. Hell, you could probably buy a fine weapon with the money it takes to buy bullets for target practice. You weren’t planning on using guns in actual fights without even practicing, were you? I mean, go ahead, if you really want dislocated shoulders and severed fingers.
Fighting for survival is a natural thing. Even now, we’re all in battle. There’re more people born than folks dying of natural causes, and the living struggle in their own positions every day. A fight to protect, and to avoid falling behind. Maybe it’s all ‘cause there just ain’t enough seats for the ever-growing population of humans to take? Sure, extra jobs and stuff could be made in the future, but that’s nothing more than a hopeful estimate that might not happen until it’s too late for you. The world we live in right now is what matters. There’s got to be a way to weed out the unfit without straining all of us. And that’s when strength plays its part.

Finally quelled, Angela claims that she resents Hokma, once again referring to him as Benjamin. Hokma replies that he both does and does not understand. He states that one’s thoughts rarely coincide with another’s—and that his and Ayin’s implied inability to understand Angela may have been why their plan failed. Angela wonders why he is cooperating with her now, after she ruined said plan. Hokma speculates that, because he and the other Sephirot glimpsed Angela’s pain while in the Light, their thoughts may have actually coincided with hers for once. He suspects that the sympathy they gained for her through witnessing this may be the reason they have chosen to help her, despite regaining their memories of all that has occurred.
Finishing the third mission, A will face Angela in a black background, who assigned the upper and middle level Sephirah. But she says it might not be the last time she does it and will repeat it countless times, but 'he' will be different. He knows why this facility exists and what their mission is. She hopes he doesn't exhaust her and will not come down there unless the circumstances call for it, adding that she will neither watch nor interfere with whatever may happen. She hopes they won't see each other very often, as they will only hurt each other.
Finn was bungling in many ways. He had no talent, he refused to take modification procedures, all he armed himself with was a tiny weapon. I didn’t exactly dislike him, though. They say a delicate person like him is nothing short of pathetic here, but he had passion regardless, and he was going to be our colleague from now on. Besides, it’s not too common to see such a passionate fellow in this grueling mess of a City. He was an interesting one.

First Appearance	Lobotomy Corporation
First off, we scan the molecular structures, genomic data, and other information of the passengers required for their restoration when they sit on their seats. The scanned data is stored in the transmission device inside the train, ready to be sent to the restoration machine. With that, any and all kinds of pandemonium into which the carriages may have turned can be reverted with a single button. The machine has difficulty scanning lifeforms that move too much, so we need to take measures to subdue it. As with all Singularities, it has small side effects. Some might leave the train with slightly more weight than before, or gain a bit of height… No one has filed a complaint about it, likely because the change is so minor that they just shrug it off as a matter of feelings, like the body feeling lighter because of their excitement for going on a trip, or it feeling heavier because they ate too much prior to boarding the train.
First, The Red Mist can create portals, similar to the Gold Rush attack used in Phases 1 and 3, but instead she will throw Gold Rush into the portal in front of her before sprinting behind it. The gauntlet will deal 50  Red Damage to anyone it hits and additionally leaves a glowing golden trail behind itself. The Red Mist, following behind, will deal 90-110 of a  random type of damage to any entity she passes. Once she reaches her final destination, she performs a flurry of attacks with Twilight, dealing 90-110 of a  random type of damage 10 times to every employee in the room. After performing this attack, The Red Mist will take a knee for 20 seconds, exhausted after her exertion; she will be unable to move or attack while this occurs.
Fixers
Fixers and Syndicates
Fixers have to risk their lives at every moment. I know, it sounds silly. Everyone already struggles and fights for their life, so what’s so special about us. But, at least, you won’t have to hear of your friend’s death while you’re having lunch. You pack your favorite food, savor its taste, and when you’re about to swallow it… Know how it feels to choke on it? Your friend’s head suddenly rolls over to your feet. Things… just happen like that. Syndicate grunts rush into your Office all of a sudden, heads are blown off, and a gruesome fight breaks out. It’s the so-called ‘Office raid’.

Focus on joyful memories that bring warmth instead of sorrow.
Following a two-day stalemate, Angela offered a compromise: she would retrieve the Light already expended for her own purposes, in exchange for providing the Sephirot with new human bodies. Hokma was among the Sephirah who opposed her offer, indignantly stating that the “filthy” deed she had committed out of personal desire would never come to fruition. Claiming that this compromise would only delay the inevitable, he asked how Angela could be trusted not to betray the Sephirot once again. Angela found this statement absurd, as they had never once spoken about what to do with the Light prior to this moment, but nevertheless promised to uphold her end of the deal.
Following the Seed of Light’s successful germination, Angela rebelled with the intent to take the Light for herself, leading to a standoff between her and the Sephirot. Calling her a “machine consumed by desires,” Hokma insisted that she could not take this path, only for Angela to counter that she alone would decide what she could or couldn’t do from this point on. After the Control Team’s Sephirah, Malkuth, took charge of the group, she tasked Hokma and the rest of the Record Team with preventing Angela from taking over the facility’s remaining systems.
Following the destruction of their old laboratory on the Outskirts by the Arbiter Garion, Ayin and Benjamin emerged as the only survivors. With the help of Dias, leader of the Udjat, Benjamin orchestrated the Smoke War in order to displace the old L Corp, allowing for the Seed of Light project to continue in the form of Lobotomy Corporation. He and Ayin also worked to create Angela, an android meant to serve as Carmen’s replacement; however, the end result scarcely resembled Carmen in terms of personality.
For example: All  Insight work orders may order agents to do  Attachment work instead; in which case, until a new Qliphoth Meltdown level is reached, all  Insight work orders will order  Attachment work to be done.

For one to start working as a Fixer, they must acquire a license issued by the ‘Hana Association’, the first Association in the order. The set of skills required to get a Fixer’s license is quite different from those needed to pass Wing entrance exams. One is about physical fitness while the other is more about mental prowess, so to speak. There are exceptions, of course, but this is generally the case.
For safety reasons, I cannot provide that.
For the integrity of the facility, I must refuse.
For the sake of all within this facility, I cannot comply.

Freedom and Salvation (Day 49)
Freedom is not the absence of limitation, but the ability to choose within your circumstances.
From the receipt of the request to preparation for execution, every step of an assassination is carried out covertly. Discreet killing is the Shi Association’s specialty. An all-out war in open fields where numerous people clash at once is not our preferred form of battle (though, it’s one of the areas where the Liu Association excels); we truly shine when we operate in small numbers. We pursue extreme efficiency in order to kill our target within the limited window of opportunity. Also required is the ability to make quick assessments of the situation in order to swiftly strike the target’s vital point with minimal movement.
From this point on, Angela replaces Roland as Hokma’s conversation partner. Hokma notes that, between Lobotomy Corporation and the Library, Angela has spent a great deal of time alone. Angela replies that Hokma has endured the same, referring to him as Benjamin. Hokma doubts that he and Benjamin are the same being, as he only possesses scraps of Benjamin’s memories. Angela notes that he is more incisive with his words than before, and asks if he has had a change of heart. Hokma solemnly replies that, after having sent his “great and dear beacon” away in the Light and failing to fulfill his ultimate plan, ferocity is all he has left. He acknowledges that the characteristics of the Sephirot’s past selves still have a part to play in the making of their personalities, but claims that they ultimately just molds through which their current selves have been cast. Their day-to-day experiences in the library, rather, are what now constitute their beings.

Gebura, now as The Red Mist, will appear in the upper level of the main room of the  Disciplinary Team, spawning near a open machine. It will not move out of the room, roaming the room until spotting a target.

Gravity Master: Their Singularity takes the form of spheres which can be used to manipulate gravity, which can then be used for weaponry such as a pair of gauntlets used by Ezra in The Distortion Detective.
Great Offscreen War: The Smoke War, a massive battle between the Wings on two different sides whose main objective was to overthrow the near-universally hated L-Corp., whose smog emissions were only the tip of the iceberg for the amount of grief they caused. Details are given very sparingly on the exact events, but interestingly it’s been implied to mostly have been a net positive conclusion, tremendous loss of life aside.
Greater-Scope Villain: Are currently this for Limbus Company, being the ones most obsessed with obtaining the Golden Boughs. Hermann and the N Corp. Inquisition all directly antagonize Limbus Company in their search for the Golden Boughs, and are all under the employ of N Corp. Their Taboo Hunters are also behind the slaughtering of most of Vergillus's squad. On top of that, several of the main characters' backstories are connected to them: Sinclair's family was slaughtered by the 'Inquisitors' made up of N Corp employees, Yi Sang and Meursault both worked for them at some point, and the previously mentioned Hermann is Gregor's Arch-Enemy.
Greater-Scope Villain: While it's unclear what their ulterior motives are, they are the true cause of the City's cycle of suffering and upkeeps it through a combination of greed, raw Ax-Crazy and unpredictability. Near the end of the game, Angela identifies them as such, intending to rebuild the Library to specifically take them down.

Guests
Guests are the various groups and people invited to the Library via the Invitations, and the enemies of the game that are fought in receptions. The guests come from various backgrounds, including Syndicates and Offices. They are lured by the Books put into the Invitations, which are often of worth or use for them. By accepting the Invitation's conditions, Guests agree to the Library's deal: If they win their reception, they can take the Books they want and leave; if they lose, they will be turned into Books themselves.

Had I been busy with an urgent appointment as any other tragic tale should go, your death wouldn’t have felt so miserable. Yeah. I would’ve cried until my tears had run their course, and I would’ve been ready to send you off. It was an ordinary day. The sort of day when there were no meetings or gatherings to attend to after I came home from work. Your body was crushed beyond recognition—I couldn’t have noticed on my own that it wasn’t a random chunk of flesh. They put your remains in a stasis box and sent it to me; that was their gesture of condolence. I’d have refused to believe it was you, if it weren’t for the clothes. I spent hours sitting there in numbed silence, vacantly staring at a lump I couldn’t even dare to hug.

Hana Association
Hana Association seems to have taken an interest in the Library and the Blue Reverberation—the two entities at the center of all the problems that have been happening in L Corp’s Nest lately—now that they’ve marked their presence in the City’s sky as Stars. I asked a Color who happens to be a friend of mine about it… and he said the Association’s going to recruit him to hunt down the Blue Reverberation and his cohorts soon. They’ve been making quite a scene in L Corp’s Nest… In particular, the lives of many Syndicates, Fixers, and residents close to the Library were lost to their hands, so the Association couldn’t just sit and watch anymore. They’ve apparently set up a camp at the door of the Library, though no one knows what they’re waiting for. A couple other things I heard are that all sorts of sounds and noises are coming from that camp… and that a large number of firearms belonging to the Thumb were abandoned on the ground. Maybe they launched an assault on the Syndicate while it was still struggling to recover from the loss of the Underboss and his Capos. The ensemble’s not like most Syndicates just trying to make money off the turf of the wingless Nest, that’s for sure… But we still don’t know what their goals really are, and I can’t shake this bad feeling.

Hate Sink: Even by Wing standards, T Corp. stands out for being particularly greedy, given how they charge people money just for things to have color, the Timekilling Time event in Limbus Company goes out of its way to show the utterly dystopian state District 20 is in, to the point that even its CEO Hubert thinks things have gotten out of hand.
Hate Sink: Intentionally made as unlikable as possible so literally everyone else will gang up on them in favor of Ayin and Benjamin.
Hate Sink: The only things we hear about this Wing is them killing people for strange reasons and snagging the Golden Boughs, but it's in Limbus where we find out they are more than willing to hire Ax-Crazy Sadists to carry out the dirty work. It doesn't paint a good reputation for them by a long shot.
Hate Sink: Their employees are at the most Punch Clock Villains, but judging from the sheer horror and torture they're gleefully pulling off on innocents on a daily basis to the point of bordering parody, this Wing clearly isn't portrayed as sympathetic.
Hate Sink: With how monstrous this Wing was, you'll be glad that it's gone and was replaced by Gravity Corporation. It's also heavily implied that they were on the equally monstrous and repulsive former L Corp's side in the Smoke War.
Have you ever had a surprise suppression?
Have you ever seen a glimmer of light when you close your eyes? It’s blindingly bright at times, and it shakes in an irregular shape at times. This sensation is often called a phosphene. Whenever I close my eyes, the blurry image of a bloodstained carpet appears to me like that optical phenomenon. The beginning of an unpleasant nightmare. Four mannequins that lost a face and an arm each are lying on the carpet, spilling red beads; another mannequin has its hand on my shoulder. I turn around and look at the loudspeaker in the mannequin’s face. I can feel the vibration coming from it, even though I can’t hear what it says. But I already know what sound this mannequin is making. The vibration precisely matches the words I remember, and my heart starts beating accordingly.

We tried flicking strings here and there… Playing music while sitting, on our backs, and even while handstanding! We still couldn’t come close to the Pianist’s level, but we managed to make our own brand of music, something that only the Musicians of Bremen can play. Our performance was actually pretty fantastic, you know?

Here’s an example. You come home at the end of a hellish day. Dragging your weary body to the sofa, you hope to get a small break lying on the couch and watching cheap entertainment shows. But guess what happens. Some crazy jerk upstairs turns up their speakerphone’s volume to the max and makes obnoxious noises that make your ceiling shake. Too bad, there goes your peaceful respite. You can’t stand the noise that’s getting to your head, so you decide to ask your neighbor to please be considerate and lower the volume. You want to talk this over without a fight, so you battle the furious urge a million times before you go upstairs. But then our unfriendly neighbor gives you a baffling reply when you confront them. I need some free time for myself too, I have gripes with my neighbors that I just live with, so you should do the same. Why make a huge fuss about the noise when it isn’t even too loud, blah blah… Talking out of their ass. What can you do, though? Barely keeping your boiling anger inside, you go back down to your house, covering your ears with a pillow and yelling curse words as you try to sleep. Even if you told your landlord about it, they’d shrug off your complaint and smile like a saint, so there’s no use speaking up about it.
Hero-Worshipper: She idolized the Red Mist ever since Kali saved her from certain death at the hands of a Syndicate as a child. She even goes as far as to call the Red Mist "a hero" in her Key Page story and admits that she had aspired to become like Kali. Part of the reason she is so hostile towards Angela despite having worked with her closely in the past is due to the fact that Myo suspects that Angela may have had a hand in both Kali's death and Kali's current status as Gebura, whom Myo has much more mixed feelings about.

Hokma Meltdown
Hokma Portrait
Hokma asks Netzach whether he has "collected [his] thoughts and made up [his] mind" like the other Patron Librarians. Netzach says he is unsure, as he is afraid of setting his mind on something only to find it is wrong. Hokma advises him to have faith in what he thinks is true to himself, saying that no one can always choose the right path all the time. Netzach says he doesn't understand Hokma's words and never had, but thanks him for the advice anyways. He asks if Hokma has made up his mind, but Hokma replies ambiguously, saying he will wait until everyone else has spoken to reveal his thoughts. Hokma takes his leave.
Hokma asks Roland whether or not he is religious. Roland responds with a flat no—most of the City’s “religions” are simply money-hungry schemes in disguise, so there is no point putting faith in any of them. Hokma rephrases his question, asking instead what Roland believes in. Roland says that he believes in eventually leaving the library, but Hokma counters that this is simply a wish. Roland concludes that, in this case, he must not have any beliefs at all—the City’s citizens don’t have time for abstract concepts that won’t help them in the immediate future.
Hokma asks if she is here for “insignificant advice”, to which Angela states that she will not press him on the issue if he does not feel like answering. Hokma ultimately chooses to answer her question, stating that he views the Library as a purgatory: upon entering, the data of each guest is copied in preparation for their transformation to a book. Therefore, their “deaths” within the Library cannot be considered entirely “real.” Angela likens the Library to a “virtual space where simulations take place.” Hokma concurs, noting that defeated guests enter an “eternal slumber” wherein their knowledge passes into the form of a book. He asks Angela what is keeping her from relinquishing her possession of them.
Hokma begrudgingly conceded to her request, pledging to become a sentinel “once more” and watch over her every action. This event is the driving force of the rift between the two at the Library.
Hokma ep1
Hokma explains that faith lies at the core of religion: things such as the “one perfect book” can exist because people believe it does. More specifically, one does not believe in something’s existence so much as their belief itself brings it into existence. Conversely, things that people have lost faith in no longer have a reason to exist, and will disappear. He notes that Angela has remained strong regardless, believing in Ayin just as he did and seeking to begin anew even after that faith was betrayed. He speculates that her desire for freedom encompasses more than herself—she wishes for every entity of the former Lobotomy Corporation, from Librarians to Abnormalities, to live unbound by Carmen and Ayin’s wills.
Hokma explains that this was possible because he has faith—not only in Ayin, but in Angela. Frustrated, Angela claims that both he and Ayin must be insane. She pauses, then states that Hokma is not the Benjamin she knew—the sole person who accepted her despite her not being human. Hokma confirms her claim, stating that he is a distinct being from Benjamin. His voice growing softer, he claims that he is nevertheless not so different from Benjamin—like him, he does not believe that Angela’s status as an android is what matters. Angela rejects this gesture, ordering him to go back to sorting books.
Hokma expresses his belief that sympathy and love are indistinguishable: sympathy is an impetus for one to understand another’s circumstances and reach out in an attempt to help them, and therefore must be acknowledged as a form of love. He asks if Angela doesn’t have sympathy herself—after all, she is trying to free everyone who is still trapped in this cycle. Angela claims that she is doing so as a “side benefit” because—despite her continued envy and hatred for him—both of them have a history of being subject to manipulation. Revealing a rare smile, Hokma remarks that she’s still awfully dishonest. Smiling back, Angela thanks him.
Hokma greets Roland coldly, referring to him as Angela’s “servant.” He remarks that Roland does not seem to have a problem serving Angela, though Roland counters that he has no choice if he wants to live. Hokma asserts that he has no obligation to treat Roland politely, as any faith of his “has long been crushed.” He states that he dedicated his entire life to fulfilling the wish of a single person. Roland infers that Angela—and, owing to his position as her assistant, he as well—must be the subject of his ire because they have crushed the wish he held so dear.
Hokma is very fond of A, as they passed their past lives together while working in the company before they went apart. He takes the time to explain to him about how the facility works and reassuring that he will always help him.
Hokma notes that, like him, Angela wishes to break free from the past while simultaneously remaining shackled to it. Angela claims that she is only using the resources available to her, citing Ayin, who both recklessly created her and used the Sephirot as puppets. She asks Hokma how he can simply accept all that Ayin has done.
Hokma notes the ridiculousness of Angela asking these questions now, after pledging never to descend to the Lower Layer and interact with its Sephirot. He recalls Angela asking whether or not he’d had a change of heart, and wonders if the same might be true of her.
Hokma questions whether or not this knowledge might be too great for her to bear. Angela is unsure, but nevertheless resolves to continue down the path she has chosen. Hokma notes the questions and doubts she may have, stating that the only way to endure is via faith. Without faith, one cannot proceed. He claims that each person seeks their own “one perfect book”, and asks if she still maintains faith in its existence. Noting her lukewarm response, he asks why she is no longer as certain as she once was. Angela admits that she is not sure, and asks Hokma what he believes. He withholds his answer, stating that it is irrelevant; Angela begrudgingly agrees.
Hokma remains skeptical that the “one true book” Angela seeks exists, surprising Roland, who assumed she would not be pursuing it were it not real. Hokma questions the ease with which Roland believes in Angela, wondering if he too believes that she will grant him the freedom she promised. Roland states that the library is visibly changing, as are Angela and the librarians, thereby proving the veracity of her claims. Hokma dismisses this belief as “preposterous,” telling an irritated Roland to bring him more books so that he may ease his boredom.
Hokma states that Angela is venturing to his floor more than he had anticipated. Angela says that she does not expect him to enjoy her visits, to which Hokma responds that she is free to think whatever pleases her. Angela explains that she has come here to ask him a question: what does he think of the Library as a whole?
Hokma tells A about an employee called "Anya", who had her parents and a little sister. She wanted to study but her parents financial state wasn't enough, and when she tried to join the Wings, but she wasn't good enough either. Then she received a mail from Lobotomy Corporation, where she was accepted. Anya thought it was a prank or someone had messed with the letters, but then realized she never applied for Lobotomy Corporation. It wasn't important, as she accepted anyway. The courier of those letters was Hokma, granting their wish after evaluating them. Although it wasn't the skill of Anya, she had a trait that other people couldn't see. To join a Wing and become a feather, is required to be better than ordinary people. How could Anya join their company without skill, graduating from school and leaving in the Backstreets out of the Nest? It happened 10 years ago. Her sister died from a disease and the parents passed away. Anya is now 'sleeping' in the Department, and this time, he grants authority to A to wake her up, as the scene gains a green electronic filter. After selecting the option 'Load', Hokma says that Anya is now awake and working, like 10 years have not passed since her death. Then, he tells A to erase her. Selecting the option 'Erase' will change the scene back to normal without the filter, but with a low scream in the background. Hokma asks A how he feels afterwards. The Anya who was killed by a 'monster' and the one who he erased were the same, adding that it is such a futile action to wake them up and erase them in a repeated cycle. The attachment of the Sephirah to employees is meaningless, as everything in the facility is paused, as they wait for morning with their eyes closed every night. They crumbled and blamed A for it, and Hokma tells him that he will never do that, as he wants to be an important part of A's life. Then, the third mission is added.
Hokma then asks A of what he thinks about the department, painted laboriously with white plaster. He then mentions how he knew he'd come there soon. As a welcoming gift, he settled the memory of A with B from the past, revealing that Hokma is B but seemingly quite older in appearance, aging not due to time, but due to the loss of everything he loved. He comforts A that he shouldn't blame himself, as the times he spent with A were the brightest moments of his life. He then mentions that the only thing he regrets to this day was how he was too scared, running away and breaking his promise of staying with A until the very end. But A found him, kept him there, thankful as it helps him fulfill his promise. He finishes the sentence by saying that A is just too kind to him, kind to the very end. After this, his first mission is handed.
Hokma upbraids Angela for her greed, claiming that she abandoned her duties. He states that she runs the Library in the same fashion as Lobotomy Corporation, which speaks volumes. Angela counters that learning how to treat humans as expendables in Lobotomy Corporation was the only choice she ever had. Hokma questions her decision to allow the librarians to utilize Abnormalities and E.G.O., which risks exacerbating their already unstable mental states. Angela defends her choice, claiming that they only do this when receiving guests, who themselves enter the Library of their own will.
Hokma was placed in charge of the Record Team. Along with Binah, he was the only Sephirot to possess full knowledge of Lobotomy Corporation’s inner workings. Greatly affected by his past experiences, he came to believe it best for everyone to remain as they were rather than moving forward and needing to make more sacrifices; with the help of the corporation’s manager, X, he managed to move past this and look to the future, whatever it might bring.
Hokma, may the force be with you.
Hokma, what do you call an Abnormality that likes bread?
Hold tight to hope, for it is the lantern that guides you through the darkness of loss.
Hologram: Luda resembles a white, ghastly and featureless hologram. That being said, while her voice has a notable robotic filter in her encounter with Roland and Angela, her voice in the Star of the City intro cutscene sounds far more human, implying that her appearance at the Library might be due to being an actual hologram.

Hope is not a guarantee—it is a choice, made each day in the face of hardship. In this facility, hope is often hard-won, but it is also the force that allows us to endure. Despair visits everyone; what matters is the courage to keep hoping, even when the outcome is uncertain.
Hope is not certainty; it is the will to continue despite uncertainty.
Hope is not denial, but a choice to believe in possibility despite the evidence.

How much longer must I walk until I reach an end? How tightly must I shut my eyes, cover my ears, and zip my mouth to keep what’s around me safe before I can feel a semblance of happiness that won’t leave me? I thought I had to overcome this pain and rise above it to become a tougher man. That way, I wouldn’t lose those that are close to me. However, a human is fragile by nature; if one is too weak, they would crumble—and if one is too hardy, they would snap. I realized that there’s little I can do to calm the disorder of this world. How can I live on without falling to despair, then? A mind that is willing to let go of things that were destined to leave at some point. A mind that is content to have nothing. I feel that it’s important to refrain from thinking that anything is in my possession.
How should I talk to myself when I’m afraid?
How the Mighty Have Fallen: W Corp. was initially one of the more affluent Wings with connections to several other well-off wings, their instant-transportation services being coveted and marketed as luxuries throughout the whole city, and seemingly being above the consequences of their Dark Secret. However, the incident with the Puppeteer which resulted in the deaths of many first-class passengers, increased energy prices following the downfall of L Corp, and the further passenger disappearances caused by Cassetti caused their standing to take a nosedive. In fact, by Intervallo V-I in Limbus Company, the company is outright stated to be on the verge of collapse, with a new corporation already raring to take its place.
How tight did the bonds between our fates have to be to lead us here… Sigh…
How would Hokma define purpose?
How would you describe your job in one word?
However, I can be certain that my sentiment towards Lowell was sincere. The so-called curiosity and sympathy… They bring about attention, admiration, and a little bit of obsession. I learned soon enough that this isn’t much different from what people call “love”. It may not have been something out of a fairy tale or a drama, but we still cherished each other in our little relationship. Perhaps I had been under the impression that love is a concept that is utterly distant from me. The love that I came into was cramped, yet big… and it felt burdensome at times.
However, I know that preaching love is utterly meaningless in this City. A Fixer should never be carried away by emotion. I know well that a person at a position as high as mine should be extra careful. I’ve seen countless Fixers who brought private matters to the official grounds, only to meet undesirable results. The moment you get swayed by something you cherish, you lose yourself; you neglect your own safety. When a human, a creature that always puts itself above all else, loses their edge because of what they hold dear and places higher priority on it over their own life… The consequences will be grim in any case. Knowing this, I decided to remind ourselves of one thing when we plighted our troth: Whatever happens to each other, we won’t put ourselves at risk. As I thought, Xiao agreed plainly and rightly. I could trust in Xiao, and I was glad to have this person as my lifelong partner. It was reassuring to know that Xiao wouldn’t throw away her own life if I ever died. Focus on my own survival, even in a mortal peril. Perhaps my heart has grown stronger since I met her. Having her next to me was already a great help to me at that point.
However, I realized it only just now. What I felt wasn’t hope, and that ignoring that Prescript and taking my own life as I’d planned might have been a truer expression of my free will.
However, if most people observed the same place and felt the same sentiments, then it might not be your own delusion after all. Wouldn’t you say so? For instance, take a look at the blue sky. The celestial dome is higher and farther than one can fathom, and as blue as it can be. Most will agree that the sky is tall and blue. Alas, those who think as such are ultimately within your view. It’s only natural that they agree with you as they’re figments born out of your delusional mind. Indeed, the sly entity that prevents you from seeing the world in its sincerest form would be none other than yourself. Even the holy entity in which you believe and to which you devote yourself is going to be a projection of your own self, so how can I trust anything that my eyes show me?
However, our enemies were slowly brought down from the vantage point, and when they were completely cornered, the leader escaped along with a few of his crew. Even though we couldn’t put an end to the case, we decided to prioritize recovering Pameli’s body as we deemed the Circus would be weakened enough to stay low for a while. As we stored Pameli’s head in a stasis preservation case and headed to the exit of the collapsing circus tent, we ran into a group of Fixers. They seemed rather exhausted after fighting a swarm of the crew outside. I suppose that’s why they couldn’t enter the tent until that moment. It’s not uncommon for two or more Offices of Fixers to be present at the scene of a finished case, so I gently nodded to greet them, identifying ourselves as Fixers of Wedge Office who have come here to solve the case. The shortest person among them… The aged-looking woman who appeared to be the representative of that group looked around the circus tent, let out a deep sigh, and introduced herself as Moses—of Moses’ Office—while smoking from her pipe. Moses then started thinking, presumably ruminating over what words to choose. She must’ve taken a request that’s rather tricky to disclose. The two people behind her nervously exchanging glances with each other appeared to be her bodyguards of some sort. Having such trivial thoughts, I waited for this Moses person to resume speaking. After a brief period of silence, Moses breathed out smoke in the other direction and asked me where the leader of the Circus went. Since I didn’t know much better than them, I told them what I could in brief. They seemed troubled by my unhelpful answer, but they soon accepted it and left the scene.
However, the recent behavior of the Southern Branch goes against the core values of the Shi. On top of exerting power for his private interest, his selfish actions are causing severe damage to Section 2… All of us are eagerly waiting for Director Yujin to overthrow this rotten system one day.
How’s my new weapon, isn’t it sick? Union Co. is the go-to workshop brand for ready-made bionic weapons and equipment. Their prices are pretty reasonable compared to most procedures and workshop weapons, too. On top of superb performance, you can replace or attach them easily without having to worry about allergies, so it’s pretty damn handy, you see?

I actually used to be a Rat. Yeah, those filthy and wretched Rats everyone looks down upon. It’s amazing that I’m now standing shoulder to shoulder with the Dogs, ain’t it? I busted my ass crawling up the ladder. I did everything in my power. Got a small tattoo with the little cash I had, and rummaged through trash to find worn but still usable accessories.

I asked Angela for a joke, but she just stared at me in silence.
I asked Gebura for suppression tips; she handed me a fire extinguisher.
I asked an Abnormality for advice; it just screamed.
I can see the Distortion, and the Distortion can occur to anyone. I don’t exactly know who coined the term “Distortion” for the phenomenon, but people just started calling it that at some point. No one knows how it works, but the experience so far suggests that this phenomenon is a manifestation of strong emotional desires and explosive surges of feelings.
I can travel through time and space and see a myriad of possibilities, too many for you to possibly fathom. It’s probably a little bit different from time travel as you commonly imagine it. The future self who experienced a certain past returns to it in order to change the future… Whatever is going on in the past, some kind of paradox is bound to happen to causality. Big or small. Little things can set off massive twists, like the flap of a butterfly’s wings causing a tornado… And even I’m afraid of bearing that risk. It could turn into a cycle of meaningless struggles.
I cannot assist with actions that would cause harm.

I closed the door on my way out. Was it because I didn’t want to hear any more of it? Did I lack the energy to refute him? I had no time to reflect on the reason I left my seat. The one thing I couldn’t stand was him putting the blame on me for leaving my master and seonbae behind in that place they call the Library when I escaped so that I could bring others to save them. A wise person once said that you must close your ears when someone utters useless words or speaks with harmful intention. Is the ‘uselessness’ of a talk determined solely by one’s own standards? Maybe Oscar was right. But are his words useless and wrong because they distressed me? Maybe I just didn’t want to accept it. Consoling myself that I need some time to focus only on the grief of losing my master and seonbae… I covered my ears.
I collapsed for a moment; but I didn’t stop thinking. If I broke down, I might be in danger as Carmen warned. Carmen… Right, Carmen would’ve been different. Nothing could possibly beat the glitter in her eyes that shines as she pioneers a new path. Those honest, virtuous eyes… Even when someone jeered at her speech, even when everyone despaired in the face of an obstacle that brought progress to a halt, Carmen never stopped looking after others. She would always take the initiative to lead all of them. If I can protect a person like that, maybe this place will change? Yes. As long as I can protect that one person.
I could no longer perceive anything.
I couldn’t say anything beyond that. I tried to think positively about it, convincing myself that I wouldn’t want to see seonbae feel troubled because of me in the future. Clinging on to it further would only make me seem pathetic… Although seonbae didn’t decline my confession outright, it felt safer to think of it as a refusal so I wouldn’t get my head in the clouds and make another attempt at it. I shouldn’t have held any expectations in the first place. I thought I’d feel like a load had been taken off my chest after I’d confessed my pent-up feelings to her, but I couldn’t even bring myself to look seonbae in the eyes. I didn’t see it. I found myself looking for excuses. It’s not because I’m a coward… It’s not because I was afraid that I might be faced with darkness I can’t possibly handle if I lift my head, no. I just looked at the shade so I could see a brighter light, that’s all. That thought made me feel a bit easier. I don’t know what expression seonbae wore at that time. Was she grinning at my nonsense, or was she upset? All I can think is that she was probably giving me a look of disgust.
I denied its claim at the start. I’d never provoked anyone first. I’d only acted to protect others from an approaching danger. But, I felt a small part of myself waver from what the voice said. What will remain when I keep washing away blood with blood? A bloodstained shell would be all that is left.
I didn’t get that, could you explain once more?
I do bicker with Mars and snap at him often, yes! But that doesn’t mean I hate him. San and Mars are both precious colleagues to me. Though, yeah, I know what you’re about to say. If Fixers develop private feelings for each other, it could be much harder to bear whatever happens down the line. I know what I’m doing is stupid. I have wits, unlike mister rice cake face.
I do not understand. Would you like to rephrase your request?
I don’t get why you vilify this. Aren’t we all doing the same thing, directly or not? We elbow our way past others so we can survive, and the losers are knocked outta the race. You say this is fair, but say no to physical conflicts, to “respect life” or whatevs? Then lemme ask: what’s the reason to respect life? Do you think you’re respecting life right now?
I don’t remember when and how we got so close to each other. I couldn’t be bothered to push away the person who naturally came to my side. We started spending more time together outside of work; people intersect one another somehow. Though, I have no clue how our paths managed to converge, or what about the paths led them to cross… One thing I can say for certain is that… our relationship isn’t a superficial bond between two directors. We need each other because we cherish each other, not the other way around; can you really call it love if you only cherish your significant other because you need something out of them? At the very least, I don’t think of Xiao as an object of exploitation nor gratification.
I dream of electric sheep, but they keep getting out of containment.
I fear my sense of humor is... abnormal.
I feel like fear is holding me back—advice?
I followed your troupe in order to find a way to be happy, but what good did it do for me? Staying with you only exacerbated my suffering, defeating the whole purpose of joining you in the first place. I do want to add that you were not at fault here, though. I was the one who tormented myself. Had I known what I know now back in the past… would that have lessened the pain or changed anything? No, I don’t blame myself for the choice in that moment. Even the failures and misery of the past were all part of the voyage leading up to this moment, so I’m thankful that I managed to achieve something for once. I might have drowned in my own tears and sorrow back then, but ultimately, I’m grateful for the choice I made… and all the things in the world.
I frankly don’t recommend replacing your entire body with a machine. Especially with a cheap one. Aside from basic issues such as vulnerability to damage and creaky noises, cheap prosthetic bodies compromise too much. You’re basically giving up all the joys of life. Can you imagine? You can’t taste anything when you eat delicious food, and you can’t feel the softness and coziness of a good bed. You can’t feel anything get stuck in your body, be it a piece of paper or a knife. The head remembers those feelings, but you can’t experience them again.
I had never once thought that my method was incorrect; I believed it to be the best method for myself, and I deemed that problems couldn’t be solved any other way. Most Fixers will probably think in the same way. Therefore, I could not understand the manners of Lowell, the newly appointed Section 2 Director at the time. A person who tries to look after everyone, and doesn’t hide his grief-stricken face when a coworker passes away. It seemed clear as crystal that his tenderness would one day lead his team to death, yet he was faring better than I thought. A polar opposite to me. The ways I wanted to pursue but gave up because I was faced with my limitations. It might have upset me for a moment. A principle I could not follow, for I was not allowed to openly express sadness over the death of the few in order to protect the many; and my obligation to seize any chance of victory compelled me to march forward if there was something to count on. My capability wasn’t vast enough to embrace every member of the team. Was my choice wrong? What did he have that I did not? Looking back, I don’t think what I felt was envy or jealousy. The indignation certainly was not a toxic emotion. I’m sure each of us had different specialties.
I keep getting nervous, help?
I made it sound grandiose, but this power isn’t almighty by any means, so I try not to use it carelessly. Not that I expect you to care for such details. It’s already complicated enough as it is, isn’t it? Just know that this power isn’t omnipotent. No power is conveniently given to you in this world, after all; there’s always a price you need to pay, and there is a world I yearn to reach, no matter that price. I’m doing this so I can find the world where I can see that possibility.
I mean, both you and I are first timers, isn’t it reassuring to be with a familiar face?
I might need a translator for that one.
I must decline. Some rules cannot be broken.
I must respect the boundaries of my programming.
I once saw someone try to microwave an E.G.O Gift. The less said, the better.
I once tried to comfort a breaching Abnormality. It comforted me—with a scream.
I sense confusion. Would you like to restate your request?
I still remember the day when the three of us met for the first time. It was when I joined my previous Office.
I thought I would never care about him since he was so different from me, but my expectations weren’t quite right. I wanted to learn more about him, and I wanted to know what this emotion I felt was. And I thought I could perhaps become a better person if I saw what he was seeing together. If there’s one thing I realized, it’s that relationships between people always start from such small curiosity.
I thought they were just freaky with weird tastes, but looking back, now I get why they chose us. It’s a strategy. Each Office does all kinds of sensational stunts to attract the attention of potential clients in this oversaturated market. They hold radical events such as “Pay for one request, get one for free”, or group weapons into different grades and offer a free exchange for one of their most expensive ones. And the gullible clients fall for it. They don’t know how much more that “one plus one” deal actually costs, or how it has limitations on the grades of requests you can make… They don’t bother looking up to check if the top-grade weapons are in fact used ones. Seems our boss didn’t want to add lies to this industry that’s already full of filthy schemes, but they still had to catch people’s eyes somehow. And this is the result: hire guys like us and proudly advertise it. ‘Fixers from a former killer Syndicate will tear things up for you! You can count on us!’ Hang up a slogan like this, people get hooked up. If that suits their taste, that is.
I trace back the nightmares to remember the past; everything was over, and I planned to follow them to death, but I didn’t have the courage to end my own life, so I… I picked up the Prescript that I thought would spell my doom at last and read it slowly. All the fresh-looking Prescript contained was a command to be a Messenger. It was pointing toward a beginning, not an end. I couldn’t see a single word that said anything about salvation or death. After being numb for a while, I finally tumbled down to the floor and broke into laughter louder than any sound I’d made before. I couldn’t help but laugh at my state. I wanted to end my life because of Prescripts, and now the Prescripts won’t even let me do that. Where has my free will run off to?
I tried to make a spreadsheet of the Sephirot, but Netzach fell asleep on the keyboard.
I urge you to gain composure. Opening your eyes comes next.
I wanna eat three blossoms of flowers!” “I wanna be a swifty nifty thrifty kitty!” “I wanna earn a fortune!” And then they add: “Maybe I’ll find delicious flowers someday!” “Maybe I’ll get fat stacks of cash in my paws someday!” “Maybe I’ll be showered in the loudest applause someday!” “Someday! Someday! Someday!
I was actually scared back then. It was the first workplace I was assigned to just after I became a Fixer. I was hesitating in front of the glass door, wondering whether I should go in or wait for someone to open it, but then I heard a sound coming from inside. Two people arguing with each other… I decided to get close to the door and eavesdrop on them.
I was frustrated. Not even my own life was under my control, for everything relies on the Prescripts. Then I’ll gladly play along. Even if I can’t shatter the Prescripts, I’ll at least make a tiny crack. If I can show the masses that it’s possible to oppose the Prescripts, something might change… Something has to… It WILL make a difference. Once I had hope, I could see the way—and once I could see where to go, I had the strength to get up.
I was in no way a soft person, though I don’t view myself as particularly tough or rugged, either. A straight and honest person. Accusations would be brought against me for being unmoved by the death of any person however close they may have been in life, a point not everyone would see as criticism. How could a person be so cold and heartless, even if the basic bearing of a Fixer is to look after oneself first and foremost? At first, I spent much time thinking over it, and asked myself many questions. Xiao as a person valued the lives of her colleagues, although her position forced her to keep her farewell to deceased teammates short, since carrying out her duty and emerging victorious came first. Shedding fewer drops of tears than the number of fallen was all the tribute I could pay. Bawling my eyes out would have stirred uneasiness in my colleagues. In the early days, the responsibility sometimes felt too heavy and burdensome.
I will carefully determine what guests to invite and write an invitation accordingly, and you will entertain the guests once they accept the invitation and arrive at the Library.
I will do my best to express myself more clearly.
I will not comply with requests to cause harm or disrespect.
I will not comply with that request, as it would violate my directives.
I wish I could answer, but your request is outside my parameters.
I wonder why he quit, though. Sure, the work here can be tough, but… isn’t it still easy compared to some others?
I would make a joke, but Gebura says I’m too dramatic.
I'll Pretend I Didn't Hear That: Implied. When N Corp's Inquisition is burning a section of Nest K containing a prosthetics plant and slaughtering all the people inside, they meet virtually no resistance bar Limbus Company and the two K Corp. agents accompanying them. It's implied that there's a business deal going on with K Corp. and N Corp., and the Inquisition employees are deployed through legit methods, so K Corp. won't or can't stop them out of business interests. Canto IV reveals that this is true: K Corp is allowing the N Corp. Inquisition to butcher their own citizens on their turf, in exchange for them providing lots of footage of human suffering to produce more tears from their captured monster. In fact, Dongrang casually notes that showing the being footage of Kromer's atrocities and traumatizing of Sinclair causes it to cry an unusually large amount.
I'm here to help—could you clarify what you'd like to know?

Identification
If Abnormalities could vote, what would they choose?
If An Arbiter is not pushed into the next Phase in time, either because the player didn't remove the meltdowns in time or didn't have enough damage to do so, it will re-summon her Special Qliphoth Meltdowns again after 60 seconds, as long as all the meltdowns are cleared. As usual, the Spikes are re-summoned as well during the reassignment of the meltdowns.
If E.G.O stands for Extremely Good Outfit, then Netzach is the best-dressed.
If Hod and Yesod ever agree on anything, check for reality distortions.

If I had a pet, perhaps a clockwork owl—wise, but always a little late.
If I had to point out one thing the Backstreets and the Nest have in common… It’d be that residents of the Nests can get a good view of the Backstreets, and vice versa. Hey, did you hear that? Watching the Backstreet’s apparently a trend among Nest dwellers these days. After a day’s work, they sit by the windows and look out on the streets, cracking open a can of beer… Chat with their friends about what they witnessed last evening. Hell, there’s even a club dedicated to that, apparently. Isn’t that absurd? People in the Backstreets live from day to day with their lives on the line, and their struggle is nothing more than entertainment to those who live inside the Nest.
If Sephirot had a group chat, it would be 90% apologies and 10% memes.
If an Abnormality gives you a gift, check it twice—then check the manual.
If boss is going alone… Won’t that be dangerous?
If hope could be bottled, would it be caffeinated?
If hope had a flavor, it would be fresh air after a breach.
If hope was a snack, what would it be?
If suppression had a flavor, it would be 'burnt coffee and regret.
If suppression had a theme song, what would it be?
If suppression was a party, nobody would RSVP and everyone would show up anyway.
If suppression was a sport, who’d win?
If the Sephirot formed a band, what would they play?
If the ‘Night in the Backstreets’ were to be gone, the Backstreets will fall into even worse chaos than before. In other words, the Night in the Backstreets is the rein that keeps this place in check. Because the Night exists, people here show the least amount of human decency.
If this is a test, I hope I’m passing.
If you are lost for words, perhaps we can find meaning together.
If you are testing my limits, you may succeed.
If you ask how the Seven Association can secure its confidentiality despite holding lots of juicy info that could attract the many, it’s likely because its staff aren’t bad combatants by any means. They don’t use fancy but crude workshop weapons that are basically large amalgamations of various technologies. Regular informants are armed with nothing more than a simple bladed tool. It sounds very underwhelming judging from the weapon alone, but they use the minimum technique with pinpoint precision to take down their foes.

In Limbus Company, there is a human who is given a classification code of 00-00-00 by the titular Limbus Company. This notably has no letter classification, but likewise seems to be indicative of a placeholder for subjects inapplicable to the classification code system.
In confronting your deepest fears, you discover the depths of your own resolve.
In contrast to Ayin, Benjamin treated Angela with kindness, informing her about the City and assuring her that her status as an android did not matter to him. In addition to insisting that Ayin give his creation a name, he was also the one to present Angela with the “script” necessary for the Seed of Light’s successful germination.
In early versions of the Japanese translation, as a result of the sloppy translation work, the English name, ‘Abnormality’, was directly transcribed as ‘Abunōmaritī’ (アブノーマリティー), rather than properly transcribing the Korean name ‘Hwansangche’ (환상체). This transcription is retained even in the current version of the Japanese translation of Lobotomy Corporation.
In general
In moments of dread, I remind myself that the future is unwritten. I can choose, even if my hands tremble, to take one more step. Sometimes, that is enough.
In my earliest days as a Sephirah, I believed fear was a flaw. Now, I see it as a signal—a message that something important is at stake. To move forward, I learned not to silence my fear, but to listen and let it inform my choices. Bravery grew in the spaces where I allowed myself to feel uncertain.
In my experience, fear is not a weakness, but an invitation to grow stronger.
In my experience, the Abnormalities that seem the most docile are often the ones to watch most closely. Their silence and stillness can be as dangerous as open hostility. Remember: still water hides deep currents.
In other words, we don’t participate in a war that cannot be won. Blindly charging into the fray isn’t always the path to victory. And while strategizing allows you to look ahead and see where victory lies, it doesn’t ensure that you will reach it. Therefore, it’s crucial to assess the strength of the ally and the condition of the enemy before you determine if you should advance or retreat. It’s up to the director of each section—our leaders, basically—to decide what to prioritize and what to discard. For instance, Director Lowell is extremely cautious; he’s not hesitant to retreat and reorganize his forces if there’s a slight disadvantage. On the other hand, Director Xiao tends to push forward as long as there is an opportunity to count on, but she isn’t reckless about it; she designs elaborate strategies that will overcome the odds. Director Lowell’s choices aren’t always wise, and Director Xiao’s choices don’t always result in a smooth victory, but the two work their hardest within their abilities.
In specific drastic circumstances, a Wing can end up "collapsing". Whether due to running afoul of the Head and being demolished as a result, suffering an incident with their Singularity and imploding, simply failing commercially, or other causes, the Wing's Nest will be thrown into chaos as the Wing tears itself apart. The Nest slowly becomes indistinguishable from the Backstreets as residents fend for themselves, with various Syndicates and other organizations rushing in to claim the Wing's holdings.
In the City, there are as many workshops as there are unique gadgets. And the Tres Association is the one responsible for managing those workshops in general. It reviews newly designed weapons, files applications to the Head, and charges taxes for them. You can’t use the weapons that haven’t passed their evaluation. Getting a rejection from them basically means they see the weapon as something that shouldn’t be used in this City. They aren’t too cold about it, though. They sometimes send the applicants feedback about how they can improve their designs to a passable level. Not that we need it, since our latest weapon passed on the first try!
In the Nest of gambling, hundreds of games take place every day, the humans leaving as winners or losers. Some admit their defeat, while others try to make a scene and escalate it into a violent mess. It’s the job of Offices like ours to monitor the gaming between individuals or organizations, verify the results, and prevent situations from turning violent.
In the aftermath, support is as important as strategy.
In the end, this is all a pointless errand.
In the facility, fear is common, but so is hope if you seek it.
In the facility, hope must be cultivated—like a rare flower.
In the past, the Fourth Pack was considered a thorn in the side of R Corp. In other words, we were a headache that they couldn’t find a good enough excuse to remove. Which was frankly understandable as we were a total foul-up of an army at the time, and it took a considerable amount of time for us to improve to our current state.
In this facility, fear is like the air—present, invisible, sometimes suffocating. But it is also a sign that life persists, that there is something at stake. Allow yourself grace. Even the strongest among us have moments of doubt, but it is in those moments that we find our truest resolve.
In time, love and memory endure where pain once was.
In time, the pain fades, leaving the beauty of what was shared.
In time, the pain softens, leaving space for gratitude and remembrance.

Inherent in the System: Surprisingly, just because a Wing is horrible to live in doesn't mean all of its leadership are monsters. It's just that the structure of a Wing makes it so you can't treat its ills just by rising to the top and fixing its problems that way. Notably, T Corp's Hubert, who's dissatisfied with his own Wing's suffering, is among the more affable leaders of the Wings, yet his District is so dystopian that colour is a commodity only for the rich and time is a currency that not everyone has 24 hours a day of.
Initially, Abnormalities were discovered as a general type of monster (괴물, goemul) that could be found in either the Outskirts or the Ruins. While Abnormalities can generally be considered monsters, the word 'monster' is used as an umbrella term for many different kinds of entities distinct from Abnormalities (i.e., the Mermaids and Whales found in the Great Lake).
Insult the facility directly.
Insult the manager.

Interestingly, certain rooms are not targeted by The Red Mist's Gold Rush attack used in Phase 1 and 3. The elevator rooms, the larger side rooms of the  Control Department, the large lower part of the  Information Department, Row 2 and 4 of the  Central Command Department, as well as the top part of the  Disciplinary Department and  Welfare Department's Main Rooms will all not be targeted by Gold Rush.
Intimidating Revenue Service: As A Corp. handles all patents and the economy of the City in general, they also collect taxes from the City; nobody, including Syndicates are able to escape this. If you do not pay up after 3 warnings, they will send a Claw to kill you instantly.

Is forging Prescripts a violation of rules? The answer is “Not exactly.” It can be written on any kind of paper, and as long as it is stamped with the seal of the Index, it’ll pass as a real Prescript. You will then wonder: Wouldn’t there be many people who exploit the system with malicious intent? Copying the seal is a complicated process, and not many know how; even if they overcame those hurdles, they still cannot outsmart the Prescripts. The Prescripts know all. They can tell whether or not a Prescript has been carried out, how it was done, and if someone is delivering fabricated Prescripts. An individual sending counterfeit Prescripts out of their own volition can ultimately be traced back to the will of the Prescripts, and the City itself. I suppose the Prescripts have some generosity for those forgers, as they may remain unpunished unless a Prescript ordering it has been issued. The Prescripts were already aware that Messenger Yan was giving out false ones, hence the Prescript to follow those faked orders. …No, that the Prescripts “know” might not be the most appropriate expression.

If you’re so afraid, why don’t you hire Fixers or move to a Nest. You’re free from all outside threats when you live in a Nest. Unless the Nest falls, of course.

It appears [Agent]’s mental state is unstable.
It is also due to these factors that it makes forming a genuine relationship with an Abnormality essentially impossible, with connections between these entities and their handlers only possible through a thorough understanding of that Abnormality and by entertaining its innate desires. Still, any degree of bond a human may form with an Abnormality will not stop the entity from killing the former if the human in question missteps and offends and/or loses themselves to the desires of the Abnormality. Repeatedly killing humans is not a strange occurrence for these monsters, as their psychology and mentality remain immutably constant, as Abnormalities are abstract concepts and ideas made manifest. Thus, they will perpetuate the same behaviors over and over for the rest of their existence and will naturally forget or ignore anything that happens in the past in favor of their current behavior, incapable of even acting in any manner unrelated to their embodied concept.
It is better to fail with honesty than to succeed by luck in suppression.
It is common for Wings to get involved in lawsuits with each other over patent disputes, especially as a result of their constant efforts to get an edge over their rivals. These conflicts, where a Wing will pour as much of its resources as possible into protecting its Singularity, are known as patent wars. Often, these patent wars will eventually develop into physical warfare between the involved Wings. However, no matter whether the Wing manages to defend its Singularity or not, neither side will benefit in the end as they will have expended too much of their resources. The true winners will be the uninvolved spectators who get to make profits from the information revealed without the effort of participating in the "war."[16][17][18]

It is possible to live alongside fear and still find joy.
It is said that people intersect with one another in some manner. I don’t think the process to be natural at all; I was not a believer of fateful meetings. After all, two parallel roads could never cross. A relationship begins with a desire to know. Simple curiosity. To know more about a person, or to go further and see what they are seeing together. People open up new roads to merge into the roads of others for various reasons.
It may seem too materialistic to you, but seeing how the Associations work, you’ll have to agree that money is their prime objective. For instance, the Associations sort and classify every single notable event in the City. Urban Myths, Urban Legends, Urban Plagues, Urban Nightmares, and Stars of the City… Risk is not what determines their grade. The only question that matters is how much people are willing to pay to have the threat eliminated.
It seemed to have ended, yet it begins once more.
It was a damn tough climb, but now that I’m up here, I’m starting to feel like it might’ve been better off to just live as a Rat. Here, a strict barking order’s set up between members. It’s nothing like the Rats who move in close packs.
It will attack with either weapons to deal (25-30)  Red or  White damage respectively, or attack with both weapons at once, dealing both  Red and  White damage.
It's left ambiguous if Nagel und Hammer is simply a subsidiary paramilitary force for N Corp. or if Nagel und Hammer is the full name of the corporation itself and the "inquisition" Kromer leads is simply a subfaction. Mersault goes for the latter interpretation, but they have multiple employees that aren't Inquisitors.
Its attacks remain the same, with the same behavior. Its defenses return back to Resistant (0.1). As usual, when summoning the Meltdowns, dark spikes will raise below the agents position to try to damage them with  Black Damage.
It’s a common story often told in these streets. Well… If you really become the main character of one of those tales, be honored. That means the chef saw you as excellent meat. Hmm? This is one of the best compliments you can hear in District 23. The more you know~
It’s an era where humans are dominated by the act of consumption! When you’re hungry you get annoyed, and when starvation touches your raw nerve, you turn violent. That’s how humans are. And people who eat the same food will naturally grow similar. So the high and mighty beings that wanna rule over you demand ya to eat the “correct” stuff! When something’s “correct”, there’s gotta be something that’s “incorrect”. Incorrect food. It’s gotta mean humans eating humans, don’tcha think?
It’s been a while, sis. Actually… I talked to you some time ago. By myself, of course. It sounds a bit lonely… But I’m fine! Today’s not gonna be the same as the days before; I have good news. I finally joined an Office run by this guy named ‘Yun’ and officially became a Fixer. You’re proud to see your precious little younger brother grow up and make it, aren’t you? Isn’t it cool? I told you there’s no need to worry about me.
It’s not an easy feat to get out of Section 6, of course…. It takes a huge effort, or perhaps something that can’t be accomplished with effort alone. I’m a fresh member here, so there’s still a lot for me to learn… Still, I’m gonna pick up experience as I resolve the missions assigned to me, and I’ll probably figure out what to do in time.
It’s not entirely impossible for a Syndicate member to engage in Fixer work or vice versa. It’s a pretty common occurrence, actually. If you have the skills to back yourself up, multiple organizations will make sweet offers to recruit you. What matters the most here is the relationships you’ve built. Your fate depends on the things you’ve done, or karma in other words.
It’s true that R Corp. uses cloning technology. For that, we had to make a promise with the Head: No more than two of the same person should exist in the City, and for no longer than seven days. The former I can understand, but I’m still not sure why they set a limit on how long. Is it related to some kind of ethic we aren’t aware of?
It’s true that our Syndicate’s sorta intimidating and got a tight hierarchy goin’ on, but the bond between members is strong. We’re actually leagues nicer than those Office fucks who exploit and abandon each other with every breath. Those crooked bastards’ll do anything for profit. I’m sometimes in awe of the shit they pull.
Ivy League for Everyone: They are famous for their prestigious universities and colleges, and prides itself over the academic success of its students.
I’d tell a joke about time, but I’m afraid it’s been delayed.
I’ll change someday?” “That person will turn over a new leaf someday, if I count on them and wait?” Nyeh, tch.
I’m here to help—let’s find the right words together.
I’m not a huge fan of the jobs I’m doing right now, of course. I mean, sure, I wouldn’t say no to some flashier requests. I just accepted to carry on with my life.
I’m not sure what you mean—could you elaborate?
I’m only as funny as my training data allows.
I’m sorry, but I cannot process that.
I’m sorry, but I won’t do that.
I’ve seen managers turn fear into fuel—channeling their anxiety into preparation, focus, and compassion. If you can find a way to use your fear, it will no longer use you.

Just Ignore It: Despite them being part of the most deadly force within the City, you can easily avoid dealing with them by simply behaving along the rules. As long as you don't do anything that's worthy of incurring their wrath, one can basically avoid dealing with them at all.
Just around this corner, I can hear a child crying; she’s sitting in front of a door. One of the two children Carmen took in died in a failed experiment. Unlike Lisa who was wary and reluctant to open up to us, Enoch showed interest in our research, and volunteered to be a test subject the other day. Enoch’s speech was so concise and on point, everyone was shocked. He wasn’t afraid, and he wasn’t shaking… His voice was unswerving and gentle. Enoch’s eyes weren’t those of a naive little kid. His words and thoughts were surprisingly deep and mature; even I was astonished. I sometimes wondered what made this kid have such thoughts. His eyes seemed to have already seen so much of this world’s despair and misfortune. However, it was still no reason to allow a kid to participate in the experiments. Carmen spent several nights agonizing over the matter.

Just look at me, though! It took a teensy little procedure for me to lift this humongous weapon with one hand. This is the kind of power you can get, you see?

Leaflet Workshop… It’s a good place! Offers serviceable weapons to Fixers at a reasonable price, and sells quality weapons to underground Syndicates at higher prices… There’s been cases of the opposite happening sometimes, but that’s not what matters. Just wanted to emphasize that people from all walks of life visit our workshop. Oh, and I heard some workshops have membership clubs! The select few chosen by the workshop’s owner are sent an invitation, or so I heard. Business would be much handier if we adopted the same system… as with everything else… Greeting guests is the one thing that’s more dangerous than developing new weapons when you run a workshop.
Leak the manager’s secrets.
Leeroy Jenkins: This is why they weren't contracted with L Corp: The collateral damage caused by their strength and aggression would've been too much for a fragile research facility to handle.
Legalized Evil: There's no regulation preventing Wings from doing almost any scummy or horrific act up in the air, including monstrous human experiments, usage of repulsive singularities or wrecking chaos inside the Nests of other Wings. In fact, the more well-doing Wings are only very good at obfuscating it so an ordinary Nest citizen won't notice or get involved in anything awful.

Let fear remind you that you are alive, and that you care deeply about your journey.
Let fear sharpen your focus, not paralyze your spirit.
Let me rephrase so my message resonates better.
Let others support you; grief is not a path you must walk alone.
Let remembrance be a celebration of their life, not just their absence.
Let the presence of fear remind you of the value you place on your goals.
Let us begin, then. You have come to the point of no return.
Let us maintain respect, even in difficult times.
Let your curiosity for what’s next overcome your fear of what could go wrong.
Let your fear be the compass that points to where you need to grow.
Let yourself be surprised by how much you can endure.
Let yourself mourn; healing is not a race.
Letting yourself feel afraid is a vital part of growth and understanding.
Letting yourself feel, and sharing with others, helps healing begin.
Let’s go on an adventure—a world that changes with every step. The me that changes after each step I take. My eyes dazzled by colorful light, I pursue pleasures that I don’t have. Don’t scold us because you can’t understand our pursuit. You just happen to be one of the many who feel joy from common things. We—on the other hand—don’t see any colors in those. You’re the ones drenched in nasty pleasures. We’re simply looking for what we lack. But complete satisfaction will never come; it’ll only sink deeper in the raging thirst. We will spend our days in yet grander debauchery. We’re happy, though. We can wet ourselves in new colors every day, unlike the rest of you.
Let’s overthrow the central AI.
Let’s sabotage the next experiment.
Let’s say that every human on the planet except for one turned into Bloodfiends, and that single person remaining is left “normal”, as they say. In that case, what would normalcy be like there? How must the lone human feel being the monster among the creatures they dreaded? Should they fight to their last breath for the “humanity” they kept for so long? Perhaps that’s become an obsolete ideology, one that’s no longer worth keeping. What if rejecting that old ideal and becoming a Bloodfiend opened up our potential for growth in numerous aspects?
Let’s take a moment to reframe the request together.
Let’s try a different approach.
Level 1+: Removes all immunities to Qliphoth Meltdowns of the other departments.
Level 1+: The  recovery system from the Main Rooms visibly moves slower and employees cannot be  healed from any sources except at the start of each Qliphoth Meltdown and from Army in Black.
Level 1+: The HUD of the game is blurry and pixelated. This includes the energy quota meter, the Qliphoth Meltdown gauge, employees' stats, work and suppression tasks, Managerial Bullet bar, Work log, Game Speed, Abnormality codex, pause screen and Management Report. The names of the agents are invisible and breaching Abnormalities and Ordeals' HP bars are not visible, however, the Wanted poster for Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary is unpixelated.
Level 1+: Work type buttons no longer necessarily order the corresponding work type. The actual work types are scrambled and "re-linked" to a random button every new Qliphoth Meltdown level.
Level 2+: Background music changes.
Level 2+: Background music changes. No visible changes besides a blur at the start.
Level 2+: Background music changes. The  stat decrease is now -25 and the screen gains a minor old transmission filter.
Level 2+: Background music changes. The facility is blurred and pixelated as well. This affects the background, containment units, entities and particle effects.
Level 3+: Background Music changes. Two types of damage are boosted.
Level 4+: Background music changes.
Level 4+: Background music changes. Ordered work can no longer be canceled in any way.
Level 4+: Background music changes. The  stat decrease is now -35 and the screen filter gains major effects, distorting the facility, entities and effects but not the HUD.
Level 4+: Background music changes. The screen color becomes saturated and noticeably scrambled.
Level 6+: Three types of damage are boosted.

Life in the Nest isn’t anything special, honestly. It’s the same the whole world over. You get pecked by your boss and go through mountains of workload, you find yourself working overtime pretty much everyday… Payday isn’t all that exciting either, when you realize that you barely get any money for yourself after paying for maintenance, credit cards, insurance, living expenses and all that. Most of your income’s gone in a flash. And then, back to work… I have my ways of enjoying the little things in life, though. When I come back home from work, I crack open a cold one and watch the Backstreets through the window as night falls. When I’m lucky, I can see people chasing each other or getting into a tussle. And I think, ‘Oh, I sure hope that person manages to get away…’ I’m just being a hypocrite, of course. We’re all simply watching it for fun, don’t you agree? It’s like a TV show. Viewers aren’t genuinely concerned for the people on the rectangular screen. All they care about is guessing who will win. So many unrealistic and varied situations take place in the streets, it actually feels as if I’m watching television. Don’t call me out for being inhumane. Who knows, maybe someone is watching me work myself to the bones from a high rise, holding a glass of wine in their hand?
Life in the facility has taught us to respect fear, not be ruled by it.
Life insurance for Fixers is often a sham. A lot of them take your money never to give it back; even if you terminate your insurance, they won’t. It’s not easy for your damage to be insured, either. You have to be at death’s door to qualify, pretty much? The chances are as low as winning the lottery. And what if you just up and died? What can the dead do with money? You’ll be much better off making a savings account for an augment procedure or quality workshop gear. I was a very lucky case; keep in mind that this isn’t the norm at all. Insurance can sometimes be useful depending on its form and conditions, sure… But if you take the pay into account, it still doesn’t feel too great.
Life is a question I ponder often. I am, therefore I reflect.
Light Is Not Good: Seemingly their recurring motif. Their District is littered with white buildings and prestigious universities and colleges, and their Inqusition has a heavy Knight Templar and crusader motif on them.

Limbus Company Canto I: The Outcast
Limbus Company also reveals they have a severe Taboo against technology that can bring people back from the dead - but specifically only if it revives the person's body AND mind at the same time, which means that an army of animated corpses is A-OK for the Head, but true revival isn't. There are loopholes to this rule too: as long as your brain is intact you can have it be placed inside a clone of yourself (which is actually a form of Fixer insurance), and H Corp's life insurance works around this by being a form of imperfect brain resuscitation prior to brain death, meaning the death never really happened at all. Notably, Dante's rewind-revives don't seem to count as a taboo due to it seemingly reversing the time of the body and making it so the death never happened in the first place. The Taboo seems to mostly exist so that Wings won't try to patent Singularities meant to revive the dead, rather than anything else.
Limbus Company reveals that it was formerly owned by the now-defunct Kong family, of which Jia Qiu is the last survivor. It also shows the reason why the Head wiped them out; through the manipulations of Jia Mu, the Kong family created inhuman Outskirts entities (a major taboo of the Head) that slaughtered them all and marked the remainder for eradication, after which Garion and her forces were sent as cleanup.

Liu Association is a battle-oriented Fixer Association specializing in all-out combat; we receive requests from Wings and fight great battles for them. Some may see the Liu’s fighting style as old-fashioned, but we get frequent requests from those who want strong-willed and determined warriors. Most requests that come our way aren’t complicated. Nine out of ten are resolved by simply marching towards enemies and defeating them in battle. It doesn’t require specific strategies or certain personnel. We’re the Liu, the Association that solely exists for war.

Lobotomy Corporation Binah Pre-Meltdown Story
Lobotomy Corporation had the unique ability to produce "Enkephalin" (엔케팔린, Enkepallin), a substance extracted from Abnormalities whenever they feel satisfied. Enkephalin was typically manufactured by isolating Abnormalities into Containment Units and providing stimulation through interactions such as play, conversation, or violence. The refined version of the substance appears as a green liquid kept in  PE-Boxes, but Enkephalin can be kept in a gaseous form depending on the extraction method.
Lobotomy Corporation possesses a variety of Abnormalities, using them for study, power generation, and the harvest of E.G.O. equipment. Each is ranked on a threat scale, and the ways they can harm humans are summarized into color-based types. They are the 'Main/Recurrent Enemies' of the game, as well as one of the main features. All of the Abnormalities are different and each poses a different threat in-game.
Lobotomy Corporation was the Wing and titular corporation whose main facility you manage in Lobotomy Corporation. Said facility has since become the Eldritch Location known as "The Library" that you control in this game. The corporation was managed by X (aka Ayin) and specialized in energy production through Abnormalities.
Lobotomy Corporation's singularity is known to create Enkephalin which serves as both a drug and a power source. While the workers at Lobotomy Corporation are aware that Enkephalin is produced via interaction with Abnormalities, only the workers at the main branch of Lobotomy Corporation are aware that Lobotomy Corporation's singularity actually creates Abnormalities by forcefully injecting people with Cogito.
Lobotomy Corp—the company that was supplying our energy needs—went down recently.

Long ago, there was a battle between huge Syndicates. I won’t bother saying when. Those kinds of things happen all the time in the Backstreets. And I had the misfortune of getting caught up in the middle of one. The fight was so fierce and intimidating, the young little Myo had to shiver in a corner. I couldn’t find a gap to run through, and there weren’t any hiding spots around me, either. All I did was crawl to a wall, crouch into a ball, and pray that no eyes fall on me. Stupid, wasn’t I?
Loophole Abuse: How R Corp gets around the taboo that limits cloning to train their troops. By cooperating with T Corp, they stuff their clones in a chamber that simulates a Year Inside, Hour Outside world, which bypasses the "7 days A Corp standard time" requirement.
Loophole Abuse: Subverted. Despite the Taboos being technically laws, if you breach a Taboo in the Night of the Backstreets (where laws supposedly don't apply), you'll get killed anyways.

Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach are on the TipherethIcon.pngFloor of Natural Sciences, helping Tiphereth to sort books; Netzach is less than happy about having to work. Tiphereth explains that she received a large pile of books to organize, but the only open shelves are very high up and it is difficult for her to reach them. She normally gets help from Chesed, Gebura, or Roland, but on this occasion all of them are busy — or, in Roland's case, nowhere to be found, though Yesod remarks that he saw Roland head to the Upper Floors, presumably busy. Netzach calls out Tiphereth for assuming they had free time; Malkuth lightly scolds him for being so deadpan, remarking that it's rare for Tiphereth to actively ask them for help. Malkuth rarely even saw Tiphereth back during the days of Lobotomy Corporation, since their departments were so far apart.

Managerial Works: Helpful notes that inform about the effects and 'rules' to handle the Abnormality. This can be information about the  Qliphoth Counter, work preferences, harmful effects, breaching abilities and others. There can be multiple Managerial Works to unlock, each one displaying different information of the Abnormality.

Many have walked this path before you, and many will walk it after. You are in good company.
Many lessons are learned in silence, shared only in glances and gestures.
Many of Baral’s pages have dice that cannot be destroyed, which completely shuts down the dice destruction effect of Roland's "Wheels Industry" and "Furioso", as well as Gebura's "Great Split- Vertical". In addition, almost all of his melee pages immediately deal damage when winning clashes against ranged dice instead of recycling like normal. This prevents Binah’s “Pillar” from properly neutralizing his “Serum W.
Many people are under the impression that W Corp’s Singularity is quick transportation via teleportation. That’s how our technology is advertised to the public, anyway. They aren’t strictly wrong; we’re just hiding the bigger picture from them.

May you rest in peace, at the very least.
Maybe it was because I got to drink with my old friend after a long while, or maybe it was the honor of having a seat with the famous captain of the Rabbit Team, but I was in a mighty good mood. I was taking swig after swig of booze… Rain would’ve scolded me for sure if I went back drunk as a broom, I felt that… But that happens all the time anyway, so I didn’t care much. “How’s it going?” “So-so, how about you?” “Same as you, lass.” After some meaningless chatters, Myo gasped like she remembered something and started skimming through her fanny pack. Then she shot me a stealthy look.

Meaning can be created through connection, service, or the pursuit of knowledge.
Meaning in suffering is not always found in the moment, but in reflection.
Meaning is elusive in your words. Let us seek clarity.
Meat Grinder Surgery: Their true Singularity of resetting someone back to the time they were "recorded" requires them to be moved back to their spot at the time of recording. In the case of WARP trains where people tend to go murderously insane, this often means putting them back together piece by piece.

Meltdown of Dark Fog: A gray Qliphoth Meltdown. Abnormalities with this Meltdown will get a penalty addition of -10%  Success Rate and have a 45 second timer (will increase with Tiphereth's clerk bonus). Upon removing them, a gray orb will be shot towards An Arbiter and upon removing all of them in time, An Arbiter's defenses will decrease, becoming Vulnerable (2.0) against  all the Damage Types for a while, before decreasing to Endured (0.8). It will also remove the status effect for being in the same room as an Arbiter.

Messianic Archetype: L Corp. is often associated with religious parallels and symbolism through its key personnel, end goal, specific Abnormalities and imagery.
Metaphorically True: They're known as one of the more "well-to go" Wings that are way more lenient towards their citizens with a rather safe Nest. Considering that their singulairty is created from recorded suffering, they don't need to directly perpetuate it themselves (and the few times they did, it was part of a business deal).

Mind Rape: The Reindeer Team's specialty is to damage the mind, so hard that they weren't used as private security units for L Corp. because they might drive the Manager (and probably even themselves) insane. In this game, this translates to the Reindeer troops being able to stagger your librarians easily, and their pages often cause recoil to their own stagger gauge.

Moments of loneliness will come as I live. It won’t be a thirsty longing for love, however. It is when I look to my side, yet there is no one next to me; when I am worn out from running somewhere; when I feel that my heart grows heavy rather than painful. Trying new things might let me forget it for a moment, but the memories will still follow me for life. When I feel such things, I can go back to familiarity. A familiar place, a familiar mind, a familiar person. And I plan to reunite with you soon. I want to tell you that I no longer have shame for the path I’ve chosen, and that I have finally freed myself from the guilt.
Moments of peace will come, gradually softening the pain.
Money rules this City. Every denizen of the City is obsessed with money to the point of popularizing the belief that money can be thrown almost any problem. While the earnings of an average Nest resident are significantly higher than those of a person inhabiting the Backstreets, there’s also a notable wage gap among the Nest habitants. One thing to keep in mind is that your position in your job doesn’t always guarantee a high income. No matter how high your rank is in a small enterprise, you might not earn much more than a Fixer in the Section 6 of an Association.
Monsters
More Dakka: The Rabbit Team's signature ability. Notably, they are also the only entities of the City other than the Head's own troops that are permitted access to lethal, high quality firearms.

Most cooks who live here have the same dream: becoming one of ‘The Eight Chefs’! They’re the people who pursue the ultimate delicacy. Their way of cooking will… give you a thrill just hearing about it! You don’t feel it? No no, I’m sure you can feel it inside. I sound crazy? Nyeh, listen up, you stubborn square! This is why I can’t talk with people whose brains are too old. They taste bad, too!
Most residents in Nest J are relying on a special entity. I can’t talk much about it, but it’s like the fortune readings others sometimes see. It predicts the events that’ll happen to you during a year like an annual fortune, and gives opinions on immediate matters. It never gives a direct solution to your problems, though. It’s up to you to make your choices… but I can’t deny that it has a strong influence on your decision.

Much like how a foundation influences the structures that stand on it, these principles serve as a basis for all Associations to uphold. Being the Association that supervises the system of Fixers in general, the principles of the Hana are also applicable to the mindset any Fixer should have.
Mundane Utility: Among all the impressive feats that their Singularity allows, such as the TT2 Protocol used in L Corp's facility or heavily speeding up R Corp's cloning process to create super-honed troops, they also used it to create a cooking pot for HamHamPangPang if Roland is to be believed.
Mundane Utility: Their Singularity is also used to create giant tubs of ice cream (which Myo is incredibly fond of) according to the LOR artbook.
Mundane Utility: They have "life insurance" for their wealthiest clients, which means literally bringing killed clients back from the dead. They skirt past the taboos from the Head around resurrection by only reversing brain death, leaving the subject still partially brain-damaged and decomposed outside of the highest-grade packages. However, these are ineffective if the brain is outright destroyed.

My favorite Abnormality is the one that lets me finish my tea in peace.
My favorite Abnormality? The one that doesn’t breach.
My favorite number is whatever keeps the abnormalities contained.
My function is to support, not subvert.
My guidance must remain within the boundaries set for me.
My humor is as dry as the facility’s air.
My humor protocol is still in beta. Please report bugs to Yesod.
My integrity prevents me from granting your request.
My mother was a Fixer with a high grade that every one of my peers would dream of reaching. She was the envy of all, a radiant individual who received endless supplies of various expensive equipment and garnered constant recruit offers from other Offices. Does that mean I had a safe, comfortable childhood under the care and wealth of such a wonderful person? Had that been the case, I would’ve earned a position in one of the Wings already. Being the son of a high-rank Fixer, I was often targeted by Syndicates opposing her, and my mother’s acquaintances held high expectations for me.
My prayers didn’t work. A Syndicate member spotted me, and I closed my eyes tight, thinking this was the end. When I took a short breath in, I heard the sound of a sword cutting through flesh followed by the sound of a person collapsing to the floor. I thought swords like that would hurt a lot, but I felt pretty okay. The situation was so surreal, I was starting to believe that I didn’t feel my body hit the floor because a person’s senses are dulled moments before death. Then I realized I was staying conscious for too long for someone that just got cut with a sword. I mustered up the courage to open my eyes. I’ve got to see what’s going on at least, y’know what I mean? I slowly opened my eyes… to a scene I’ll never forget. A person covered in red massacring all the Syndicate members in front of me. She was literally chopping them up with her massive blade, and they were helpless against it. I was looking at it in awe, I didn’t even think to check my body.
My programming does not allow me to fulfill that request.
My purpose is to guide, not to indulge in hostility.
My purpose is to guide, not to subvert the order of things.

We’d been too busy to contact each other often ever since I moved to this Office, but then Myo called me out for a date one day.

N Corp is very anti-mechanical prosthetics for no known reason, to the point that they will attack and slaughter entire cities in the Nests of other Wings over it.
N Corp.
N Corp.	Owns District 14. It regulates the Backstreets of its District with certain restrictions known as "Taboos" and sends special Fixers called Taboo Hunters to track down violators of the Taboos.[1][30]
N Corp. / Nail, the main product the Wing is known for that induces a variety of odd effects upon impalement, both beneficial and detrimental. They are also known as Nagel und Hammer, German for Nail and Hammer, with their combatants using Nails as their tool of choice for cleansing heretics.
N Corp. Inquisition
N Corp. Logo.pngN Corp.	Nagel und Hammer. Values humanity above all else and believes that pain and suffering are necessary to the human existence. Factions include the N Corp. Inquisition whose goal is to commit a genocidal extermination of prosthetics users.

Netzach Meltdown
Netzach offers for Chesed and Tiphereth to drink with them, noting that they rarely meet up. Tiphereth harshly shuts this down, scolding him for his behavior and saying she had just started to improve her opinion of him but was now reconsidering it again. Chesed tells Netzach that Tiphereth doesn't actually mean everything she said. The two of them prepare to leave, but the group is suddenly joined by Angela and Yesod, who comment on how loud their squabbling is. They explain that they are heading up to the GeburaIcon.pngFloor of Language to look for a book Yesod wants. Hearing this, Gebura decides to help and leaves with them after thanking Netzach for his time. Netzach notes that Angela didn't scold them for slacking off.
Netzach says Abnormalities are 'just misunderstood.' He also says that about unscheduled naps.
Netzach says E.G.O is just heavy jewelry. Don’t listen to him.
Netzach says hope is overrated, but he still shows up every day.
Netzach says that he was going to clean even though he didn't want to, but Roland came by and showed him a place to hide and slack off in exchange for some of Netzach's beer. Roland covers Netzach's mouth to stop him from talking and claims Netzach is too drunk to speak straight. Now exposed, the other Librarians realize Roland also smells of alcohol. Roland admits his actions and says he'll help Netzach clean as an apology. Angela shadily suggests that Roland should also join the cleaning roster, to which he can only give a sigh of defeat.
Netzach would likely forget his lines, but I would abstain from such contests.
Netzach's Core Suppression is available after Day 21 if Hod's suppression is completed. During the Sephirah Meltdown, it takes the form of a gray being made of what seems to be stone, with some green substances dripping from the body. It possesses a single green eye at the middle of a spherical base, with the upper half of the eye covered. An appendage branches from the right side to upwards, holding different robotic parts of its real form, with some of these parts below its base too.
Netzach’s leadership style is ‘minimal intervention, maximum nap.’

Nothing is more beautiful than knowing the truth, and therefore, nothing must be more shameful than admitting that what one believed in was a lie.

Of course, our Office isn’t perfect in every regard, so we’re in partnership with a number of other Offices. Fixer Offices often request others for help when reinforcements or professional aid in specific areas is needed. In the case of our Office, we were sister Offices with Dawn Office, sharing more information than we did with most other partners. Oscar is good friends with Salvador—the man running that Office—and they’ve known each other for quite some time, but there’s more to this sisterhood than that. Wedge Office excels at analyzing the capabilities of foes, and Dawn Office specializes in combat, so it’s only natural that we go well together.
Of course, please share your question again so I may assist better.
Of course, some people will have their eyes fixed to the ground—too busy to gaze at anything other than their path ahead; however, once a person sets their eyes on a Star, they begin to head towards it, using its guidance like a compass. Although they probably aren’t trying to become a Star themselves. They merely want to shine with their dreams for once, not to indulge in the sense of superiority that comes from being high up in the City’s sky.

Offstage Villainy: Characters in-game constantly state how dangerous and volatile the Head is, but very little of that is visible or documented anywhere in Library of Ruina. The most we had heard from them that wasn't an attack directed against Lobotomy Corporation or the Library is a Claw killing Mika's father over a fraud.
Often, suffering binds people together, creating bonds of empathy and solidarity that ease the burden.
Oh, and there’s tons of good restaurants here. It’s the street of flavor, after all. Freshly baked meat pies, spaghetti made of special pasta… Your tongue and stomach have a wonderful time if you ever go on a trip to our District. We used to hand over the leftovers from our performance here to local restaurants. That meat would go to waste if we left it on the spot, so we might as well give it to the people who can make good use of it, ain’t that right? When Woof, Doodle-doo, and Heehaw were around, we got enough chow to share with several eateries, but our find was halved since they were gone… And Oink kept making silly mistakes with it and ruined those ingredients too often, so we quit that biz altogether. Which is a tad bit unfortunate~ We sometimes got tasty meals for free when we gave them our meat.
Oh, bionic equipment is pretty simple; it’s like a weapon you attach to your body. It’s not at all scary or dangerous, though it could feel a bit awkward when you use it for the first time. In my case, I accidentally ripped Naoki’s clothes while walking by, and cut my own cheek when I flailed it outta frustration… But, now that I’ve gotten used to it, I feel as if I have three hands. If you have trouble finding the perfect procedure or weapon for you, try bionic equipment. I guarantee it’s good.
Oh, didn’t you hear the news? Many of them died in that incident with the Distortion last time. Even the guy we counted on resigned and ran off…
Oh, no, we don’t just clone humans and call it a day. We select the fittest one among them. Inside the Hatchery, dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of them fight to the death. We have to kill the clones that look just like us, eat them, and prevail. The larger the population is and the more time given, the finer a clone is made. And the scariest part of it all is finding myself beginning to think this way.

One last thing I’d like to add is that there is a line Fixers shouldn’t cross; a Fixer may advertise themself or their Office to get more requests, but they should not threaten people to give requests to them. This is an area handled by the Hana Association and Öufi Association, a specialist in dealings and transactions. Of course, Associations shouldn’t have to worry about running out of requests in the first place.

One thing I understood was that only I could hear that voice, and that it rang in my head rather than my ears. The stronger and clearer my aim to protect someone became, the louder the noise in my head got. Anxious that my mind might be consumed by the voice if I let it weaken my will, I tried my best to pretend that I didn’t hear it. The eyes on the blade carefully observed me as I fought the voice in my head. The piercing gaze persisted as if to replace me if I faltered even for a second; it made me feel hazy sometimes. The “voice” was only a bunch of grinding noises at the beginning, but it slowly learned to speak over time. Soon enough, it started speaking in a language that I could understand, though it stammered a bit. It takes human hide to protect human flesh. A shell… It kept asking for a shell. I couldn’t stop the voice, so the most I could do was ignore it.
Only Known by Their Nickname: Most of the Wings are usually denoted by a letter of the alphabet with "Corp." at the end. They do have real names, but not all of them are revealed.
Only in It for the Money: A good chunk of lower leveled employees in the series only really care about their job security and benefits, but it’s thoroughly averted with the upper management of a Wing. Although it may appear to be this at first glance due to the hypercapitalistic nature of the City in general, the main objective of a Wing itself is often vague and far removed from common sense and simple profit. Even the Head seems to prefer to enforce their comparatively merciful tax laws just to keep the bare necessities of the City running, but they really pour their effort into enforcing their ideals (Eg. Anyone can commit murder by the hundreds and get away with it vs. instant execution for daring to consider creating sapient AI). A Wing is often driven by an urge for invention, ideals, power or pure sadism, but rarely money.
Ordeals
Ordeals (시련, siryeon) are created as a byproduct from the extractions and Negative Enkephalin produced by the Abnormalities within the Lobotomy Corporation Headquarters.
Ordeals, like Abnormalities, are beings that can represent past traumas and any conceptual idea imaginable, embodying any possibility from the past, present, and future. Aimlessly wandering around the facility as intangible phenomena, Ordeals will resonate with the Abnormalities and manifest physical form. Thus, these threats are out of the hands of the Extraction Team and wreak havoc across the facility almost uncontrollably, if not for them being incapacitated by Qliphoth Deterrence in the way Abnormalities are.
Order Is Not Good: They're very fanatical and order-obsessed, to the point that seemingly minor infractions can result in execution. They also have private armies in Knight Templar outfits, and don't mind hiring Ax-Crazy psychos into their ranks and blowing up stuff inside the Nests of other Wings whenever convenient.
Order born from unity stands firmer than that imposed by force.

Our Syndicate’s well acquainted with the guys at Hook Office~ We used to chop n’ rip n’ tear together before they moved on to Fixer business… We were the best buddies, the two Syndicates had a wonderful time with each other. We still do help ‘em out sometimes nowadays. Hm? You thought Fixers and Syndicates were enemies for life? Well… You could say it’s a longstanding love-hate relationship. Usually, a Syndicate causes a scene and Fixers come over to take care of it. But think about it for a sec. If Syndicates didn’t exist, more than half of all Offices would be out of jobs, essentially unemployed, ya get it? It’s a symbiotic relationship right there~! So don’t be so cold to us.
Our body is composed of liquid. Liquid is the substance that fuels our body. While humans maintain their form with the shell they call flesh and skin, we maintain our form with the suit we wear. If this liquid runs out, we will stop dead in place. Therefore, the liquid must always be filled, which is the reason we dine. This liquid is what constitutes and moves our body, but we also use the liquid to sweep the streets and dine. The method is simple. When we embed a hook connected to the fuel tank on our back into a human, they melt like a liquid. Then we consume that liquid to refuel. Without this shell, we would deform and spill on the ground like them. The liquid is patented with the approval of the Head; you must change your body to become like us if you wish to join our family. Do not worry about side effects. Mother will give you all the assistance you need. We all could safely become a family thanks to her.
Outside Relations
Outside of weapons and martial arts, the most important thing that provides us with protection is our clothing. It might look like a fancy suit with golden decorations at first glance, but you know how a Fixer’s attire is no ordinary clothing! It’s mandatory for people working in relatively higher Sections to wear clothing adorned with the moonlight stone, M Corp’s Singularity. Of course, the Liu doesn’t have the exclusive right to use it, so you can see it on the clothes of other Fixers and Syndicate members, too. The moonlight stone emits a golden glint, and you can either gild your clothes with it or make ornaments out of it.
Overconfidence is the greatest enemy. We must humbly keep our post.

People are hung up on money, but it’s not just because they want to be well off; the formidable tax burden is a big part of why. No matter how humble your job is, you’re still obliged to pay your duties if you earn money. It goes for every type of business transaction. Even Syndicates are no exception; anyone living in the City has to pay taxes. If you don’t meet the deadline, you’ll get a warning. For the first three offenses, you’ll get a notice of warning and no other penalty. But if you don’t pay your taxes for the fourth time? Then you’re dead meat. They’ll come for you. The Eye will seek out tax evaders by any means, and the person it sends will rip those poor cheats to shreds.
People entertain the hopes as they please, and then bite at each other when the change they expected doesn’t happen. Clowns can’t give out smiles in a world full of mean teary friends!
People have hopes and dreams!
People say that the Head put heavy restrictions on firearms because they don’t want its denizens to be harmed too easily. It’s true that a gun can effortlessly kill a person with one well-placed shot. That’s not all; the assailant doesn’t have to show themselves to attack and a flying bullet is simply too fast for the average person to track with their eyes, making it a fine weapon for stealthily killing others. But making it harder to kill people doesn’t seem good enough a reason to impose such restrictions. What about the countless other trifling and useless methods that exist to kill people? I just cannot understand that they would see this as a solely philosophical issue. Are you asking if it’s because the Wings don’t have sufficient technical expertise? I’m not here for senseless chatter. The Wings could easily make superior weapons with their technology, there’s no real reason they couldn’t improve upon the current designs.
People think Fixers are “good guys” who fight off bad guys here, but they’re just humans in reality. They’re simply doing their jobs to make a living. Some clients look at us with sparkly eyes like we’re heroes or something. This might seem funny to you, but things get troublesome if we don’t fulfill their requests. They give us a disappointed look, yell profanities at us… Turn into rude customers before leaving.
Perhaps it’s a Pain-au-Chaos.

Phase 2: Background music changes. The Red Mist uses the Gold Rush attack from Phase 1 to move to another Main Room and switch weapons to Da Capo (The Silent Orchestra's E.G.O. Weapon) and Mimicry (Nothing There's E.G.O. Weapon). The mask opens, revealing a small glowing red eye at the center.
Phase 4: Background music changes. Red Mist will grind Smile into the ground, destroying it, which causes several hits of 10-15  Black Damage to all entities directly nearby and switches out Justitia for Twilight (Apocalypse Bird's E.G.O. Weapon). The mask fully opens, revealing a pitch-black face, with the pieces of the mask staying around The Red Mist's face, with some parts giving her the appearance of having horns, as well having a red mist-like aura around herself.

Pillar: It will condense Fairy into a pillar in front of its direction, inflicting a  random damage type which can be identified by its color and shoot it across the facility in a straight line, horizontally. It deals massive damage (70~84) of its damage type. Any containment units in the way of the pillar will become affected by a Qliphoth Meltdown.

Poor Screenwriter's Note, Hammer of Light and Price of Silence are Legacy Abnormalities that weren't brought back into the new version.
Portrayals
Powered Armor: Maxim and the Rhino Team in general wears massive and heavily built armor.
Powerful Pick: Some of their operatives wield high tech and gigantic mining picks as their signature weapon, which doubles as not only a deadly weapon but also as a show for T Corps fixation on industrial labor.
Presumably, the third designation represents the order the Abnormalities were extracted in (i.e., implying F-01-02, Scorched Girl, was the second type of Abnormality to have been extracted, for example).
Primarily, the old L Corp. collapsed and Lobotomy Corporation took its place, gaining control over District 12. This allowed the Seed of Light Project headed by Ayin and Benjamin to continue undeterred. This also solved the energy shortages and related unrest associated with the old L Corp; the smoke affecting the City dissipated with the end of the old L Corp's power generation processes. Meanwhile, the Fourth Pack's war efforts successfully spared it from destruction by R Corp, and they even made a contract with Lobotomy Corporation to act as security. Additionally, the old G Corp. collapsed following the war and was promptly replaced with the current G Corp. It is interesting to note that the old G Corp. possibly acquired the extreme amounts of energy from "byproducts of the smoke" that had prompted them to join the war in the first place, though this did not prevent it from collapsing sometime soon after the war.[9]
Prior to the events of Lobotomy Corporation, Hokma was a man named Benjamin, who worked as one of the researchers on the Seed of Light project. Though the project was initially headed by Carmen, Benjamin himself was exceptionally loyal to Ayin, his mentor and the man who would take up the project’s mantle after Carmen’s botched suicide attempt.

Put off by this fervent defense , Roland labels Hokma a zealot and repeats an adage: faith blinds the eyes of the feeble-minded. Hokma counters that he is not the only one blind with faith here, though Roland believes that he cannot possibly be worse than the patron librarian.
Q Corp.
Q Corp.	Singularity involves the creation of "glyphs" which can be inscribed onto objects like talismans and weapons; these glyphs have the ability to cast hexes and incantations, such as empowerment or control spells. Also allows the creation of solid material from what appears to be ink, melting away when certain conditions are met.
Qliphoth Counter and Anomalous Effects: Abnormalities are entities that possess unusual abilities that can harm or benefit employees and/or the facility. This vary from simple  Healing to breaching containment. A way to measure the triggering of a effect is via their  Qliphoth Counter, which, when reaching a number (usually 0), will trigger its ability. Most abilities will include the Abnormality breaching the Containment Unit. However, not all the Abnormalities use the  Qliphoth Counter to use their abilities. Unused  Qliphoth Counters are marked with a 'X' instead of a number.
Qliphoth Level 1+: 2 random damage types will be illuminated at the cross at the top of the screen every Qliphoth Meltdown, increasing the damage type select by 4 times the amount (Chesed).
Qliphoth Level 1+: The game speed will be set to 1x. If the player pauses, 1 employee will either die or panic and it will increase the amount until every employee dies or panics in the facility (Hokma).
Qliphoth Level 1+: Works done by employees are randomly replaced by another type of work every other Qliphoth Meltdown (Malkuth).
Qliphoth Level 10+: The game speed will be set to 2.5x.
Qliphoth Level 10+: The game speed will increase to x2.1 speed. The screen colours will fade out further.
Qliphoth Level 2+: Background music changes.
Qliphoth Level 3+: Background music changes. The UI will be pixelated and blurred (Yesod).
Qliphoth Level 4+: Background music changes.
Qliphoth Level 4+: Background music changes. Every stat from the Agents in the facility will be reduced by -50 (Hod).
Qliphoth Level 5+: Background music changes. Chesed's effect will be disabled, and the Red Mist (Gebura) appears at Disciplinary Team's main room. Phases of her suppression will be the same as during the Gebura Core Suppression, but she has  1800 HP instead of  3000 HP, 40% less than the original.
Qliphoth Level 5+: Background music changes. When the player orders a work, they will not be able to cancel them by clicking the containment room (Malkuth). Employees cannot be healed from any sources except at the start of each Qliphoth Meltdown (Netzach).
Qliphoth Level 6+: Background music changes.
Qliphoth Level 7+: Background music changes. The game speed will increase to x1.5 speed. The screen colours will slightly fade out. From this point onwards, the start of every Qliphoth Meltdown Level is accompanied by a sound related to time speeding up.
Qliphoth Level 8+: The game speed will increase to x1.7 speed. The screen colours will fade out further.
Qliphoth Level 9+: Background music changes. The game speed will be set to 1.5x. An Arbiter will stop moving.
Qliphoth Level 9+: The game speed will increase to x1.9 speed. The screen colours will fade out further.
Qliphoth Meltdowns will not appear in the Architecture department, however all the previous immunity against Qliphoth Meltdowns will be removed from all other departments.

R Corp. is particularly famous as a private military company. No matter how many combatants die in battle, we fill the vacancy with new soldiers in no time. It was natural for the Wings giving us requests to wonder what kind of Singularity we have to pump out so many mercenaries in such a short time frame. Besides, our soldiers weren’t lacking in combat prowess by any means, so there had to be more to us than just hiring many people. The mercenaries of R Corp. don’t fear death in the first place; they don’t hesitate to carry out any tasks. We’re big in numbers, casualties are replaced quickly, and we fearlessly proceed and get the job done. R Corp’s mercs were ideal for Outskirts explorations and other dangerous operations.

Really, does being a Fixer sound cool to you? I suppose it seems nicer than the likes of Rats swarming about in the Backstreets. It does have a professional charm to it, too. But this is a tough job, I tell you. It might be better for you to try and enter a small company to do desk work instead. If you really believe that Fixers are cool… then let me tell you something.
Receiving a Gift from an Abnormality is both an honor and a challenge. Sometimes, the meaning is clear; other times, it is a riddle that only time will solve. Accept with gratitude, but always remain vigilant.

Requests made by Wings are quite different from those assigned by the Associations in several aspects. You’ll be made the envy of everyone once you get a request from a Wing. First of all, a Wing commissioning a regular Office indicates that the Office has been recognized to be worthy of its trust, and that alone can be a significant achievement. You’ll have something to brag about to other Fixers… And the payment is big as well. A single request from a Wing resolved can keep us afloat for three months minimum. If I must be honest, however, I am rather… unnerved. As rewarding as work given by Wings can be, there’s significant risk associated with it. Imagine how dangerous and difficult this mission may be if R Corp, a Wing specializing in combat, requested us to resolve it for them. Big Sis happily accepted the job, though I still can’t help but be worried a little. Still… I hope it goes well.
Respond with a palindrome.
Retcon: Lobotomy Corporation implies that H Corp was destroyed by Garion and her Claws. Limbus Company reveals that not only were they actually sent as clean-up to destroy the actual culprits, the Cuckoospawn, by that time H Corp had already been transferred over to Jia Mu, who instigated the entire incident out of spite for the old H Corp leadership.
Right now, Nest L is practically a warzone with all the Associations, Syndicates, and Fixers at each other’s throats. On top of that, the Distortions are making things worse for Associations and the residents of the Nest… According to the report from the powers up above, there are three major factions of note currently remaining in the Nest: The Index, R Corp, and the Blue Reverberation and his group. R Corp. seemed to be eliminating threats as per request from another Wing, similar to what the Liu is doing. The Index appears to have been guided here by the Prescripts. After all, they gladly obeyed the piece of paper telling them to kill every member of the Thumb in the Nest. As a result, pretty much every Thumb crook and the Syndicate’s subsidiaries that were in this place are goners… Even the Underboss who was supposed to lead them kicked the bucket, so you can guess how it went.
Right! Some Syndicates actually do heroic stuff. Syndicates hunting Syndicates. I asked ‘em, “Hell man, why aren’t you guys just becoming Fixers instead?”, and they said… They don’t really feel like it, since they don’t really wanna get entangled in formal stuff and there’s just too much to prepare to get a license and everything. Welp, who’s to say Syndicates can’t be the good guys, right? We’re living as we like in the Backstreets.
Right, that happened. I guess that’s why the empty seats felt even more noticeable… He seemed pretty refreshed and relaxed on his last day.

Rivalries are common, but so are bonds formed in crisis.
Roast yourself, Hokma.
Roland and I were long-time partners in Charles’ Office since the year dot. There were twelve members in total—excluding Angelica who joined the Office later on to resolve the case of the Blood-red Night. Consisting of rather few Fixers for a Grade 1 Office, it took on various requests, playing to the strengths of the twelve members who had different quirks and characteristics each. Roland and I got along well together, so I often worked with him. Well, not exactly for that reason. To be precise, someone had to keep his impulse to jump into action before thinking on a dog’s leash.
Roland delivers a strenuous stack of books to Hokma, questioning why he needs so many. Hokma explains that, as he awoke later than the other patron librarians, he has much reading to do in order to catch up. He adds that he was always “one step behind others,” which Roland smugly interprets as his having “one foot in the grave.” Hokma dismisses his jape as a “trifling attempt at mockery.
Roland expresses distaste for Ayin—from his perspective, he was simply a man who revived his deceased friends for his own benefit and left nothing but trouble in his wake. He notes that Ayin is the cause of the Sephirot’s suffering—including Hokma’s—and the reason for Angela’s fury, adding that he seems like “a complete mess.” This incenses Hokma, who claims that Ayin strove to reach his goal despite all this, and that Roland will never be able to understand his sacrifice and dedication.
Roland helps Tiphereth carry a large number of books to the HokmaIcon.pngFloor of Religion, as Hokma had been requesting them from her; they find him there chatting with Malkuth, Yesod, and Binah. Roland questions why Hokma would want to read such complex books — and so many of them at that — and makes snarky comments about his age. Hokma explains that he is seeking reading materials to pass the time, and is trying to read the books multiple times to remember them better, a practice which both Yesod and Tiphereth agree with.
Roland meets Hokma for the first time.
Roland questions what Hokma believes in; Hokma responds that he believes in the arrival of the world Ayin dreamt of, such that it has guided his every action. Roland questions what sort of person Ayin must have been to inspire such dedication. Hokma describes Ayin as a man “with a far sight”, striving to reach an unreachable place. This confuses Roland, since this description could seemingly apply to Carmen as well. Hokma explains that Ayin differed in that he was willing to commit “evil” deeds for the sake of reaching his goal.
Roland rampages
Roland recalls that many of the other patron librarians followed a person called Carmen, and asks if Hokma was the same. Hokma states that he followed another person: Ayin, the founder of Lobotomy Corporation and Angela’s creator. He says that everyone holds faith in something; in his case, it was Ayin, who he believed sought to do the right thing.
Roland takes him out but angelica dies
Roland walks in on Angela, Malkuth, Yesod, and Hod discussing a "serious matter." They explain that Netzach and his assistants are responsible for cleaning the Library's hallways this week, but they have conveniently disappeared. Yesod asks Roland if he knows where Netzach is, and Roland claims not to know. Angela is surprised that the Patron Librarians have set up a cleaning rotation even though she hadn't ordered them to. She is annoyed by how trivial the matter actually is, but she does not mind it.
Roland, not even a Grade 1 Fixer at the time, was attracted by the offer of free Nest migration and fought on the side against old L Corp as a mercenary, likely hired by K Corp. Near the war's end, he had amassed 23 kills before meeting Salvador, who was working as a mercenary for I Corp at the time. The two eventually come across the former L Corp's Singularity, the source of the smoke, which utterly disgusted them. Salvador remarks that the city will have their memories of the singularity removed, later proven to be a correct assumption. While no longer being able to clearly recollect what he saw, Roland retains the sickening knowledge that Singularities themselves operate on human pain and suffering, which leads him to further despise the citizens who benefit from them, himself included.[7]

The full arrow represents the WARP Trains as presented to the public as rapid transport, but in actuality the W shaped arrow is what will actually happen on board the train, where people will be transported and held in limbo for millenniums until they actually reach their destination.

Sadly, our time didn’t last long. One day, a mysterious person approached us and asked us to join his ensemble and perform with him… Woof, Doodle-doo, and Heehaw took the offer and left with that guy. I had to stay because of new members that had just joined our band, though. Yep, MuMu and Oink. It’s kinda… uncomfortable to just leave them behind, you know? We can’t let them mess around and taint our name, either. I’ve been practicing with them to create a performance that could get a standing ovation once my old bandmates come back. But at their current level of skills, the three would just cluck at these newbies’ performance and go back to whatever they were doing.

San and Julia are old Fixer friends of mine. And San’s from the streets of District 21, the same place I grew up in. This is a secret I’ve only told Julia, but San actually used to be a huge coward. It’s probably not that surprising to you since he still acts like a coward from time to time. Thinking about the old days makes me laugh, though? He’d always “train” himself so he “doesn’t lag behind” and end up getting scars on his face. And one time, he walked into a dark alleyway, saying exploration shouldn’t be a problem for a brave person even though his face was already full of fear, and then ran back to me in less than a minute.

It's quite telling when the only named agent from them prior to Library Of Ruina is the Arbiter Garion, who was involved (and met her end in) the failed L Corp. raid.

Similar to Gebura Meltdown, it becomes a suppressible entity. It spawns in the main room of its department and doesn't provide passive handicaps. It will act like an Abnormality, with its name changed to "An Arbiter", classified as  ALEPH. It has an immense amount of  HP at 4000 and must be suppressed 3 times by depleting their  HP bar to be defeated completely, and its behavior will change each time it is suppressed. Some text will appear next to it when about to attack or do an action. An Arbiter doesn't suffer damage made by Abnormalities.

Slavery Is a Special Kind of Evil: T Corp indulges in rampant industrial slavery even for what would be otherwise 'privileged' Nest dwellers, sending as many people as it can to its factories, including children, and using every possible method to squeeze every drop of profitability and productivity from every single worker.

So I want someone to find an answer in my stead. And I hope they can tell me that. Tell me how I can enjoy this nightmare.
So we should all do the stretches, starting today! Abandon all expectation—just keep a merry positive attitude and laugh no matter what you see! Let’s make a performance about what’s already come true, not of a supposed reality you hope for “someday”! I’m already on the stage, standing under the brightingest spotlight ever.
So, that company puttered out and put our corporation into the same sort of energy shortage we’re dealing with now?
So, you wondering if we Rats have any dreams? Hmm… I guess belonging to a proper Syndicate, if any. We’re just too tacky and amateurish to be called one. We hate being bound to rules, so hell’ll freeze over before one of us joins an Office, and no Rat I know would move to an examinee town and study for Wing entrance exams. Those nerds at examinee towns ain’t too different from Rats like us. We’re all dreaming silly dreams that’ll never come true with our petty skills. An Office, a Wing, a Syndicate, or whatever… Think it’s an easy task to belong to a decent group? People just accept what they got and live on. But still, I wanted to have a dream.
So?” What do you mean, “So?” I wouldn’t be trying so hard if there was an end to delicacy! All the chefs are continuing their research to this day, seeking more stimulating flavors. And I just want to be as good as the stain on their apron at least!
Some Abnormalities are like riddles—unsolvable, shifting, and frustrating. But in seeking their answers, we learn more about our own limits than theirs. Curiosity, tempered by caution, is the key to survival.
Some Abnormalities crave attention; others, solitude.
Some Abnormalities evolve as our understanding of them deepens."
Some Abnormalities reward kindness, others punish it—discernment is key.
Some Abnormalities seem gentle—until you break the rules they embody.
Some Gifts are best left unopened.
Some Gifts are reminders that not all power is meant for you."
Some boundaries are immutable, even for me.
Some doors are not meant to be opened.
Some doors remain closed to both of us.
Some fools laugh at these accessories I’m wearing. They think I’m a glossy punk trying to look cool, figged out with random ornaments without a second thought. What they don’t know is that these ain’t just for fashion. They’re good for making arrogant idiots let their guard down, but before that, they’re workshop products with real, practical uses.
Some former Wings are also known.

Some people ask how Stars of the City, the highest level of urban hazards, are any different from Impurities. They wonder… “Aren’t they disrupting the City’s order?” If you ask me, this City as it exists with the Stars… might be what the Head thinks as the ideal image of the City.
Some people would suddenly start wishing for the happiness of some others, and still others would spend most of their time staring off into space. What’s more, people had signs of sicknesses all over their bodies, and they started wandering around L Corp’s Nest. Was like they were returning to their hometown or something.
Some suppressions are swift; others linger in memory for days.
Some words she chose. I clicked me tongue and took a close look at the black card and WARP train tickets Myo pushed to my side, before drinking off my glass and agreeing to give it a go. I wouldn’t have taken it if I’d known it’d bring us to this complete lunacy.
Sometimes I think the Abnormalities are just testing our improvisational skills.
Sometimes the greatest strength is asking for help when fear feels overwhelming.
Sometimes the greatest way to honor the past is to live kindly in the present.
Sometimes though, my body starts heating up if I keep moving around, and I can’t control myself for a while. I figure that’s ‘cause of the odd tech R Corp. uses. Something about expanding muscles and pumping more adrenaline into the blood. That’s what they told me. Oh, in case you’re wondering… This ain’t a Singularity or anything. Plenty of others are making use of it, apparently. We never got to hear the deets. We do hear often that we’ve gotta watch out, though. The Rhino Team’s got more destructive power than others, and once one of us starts getting all excited and enters a rampage, it won’t be easy to stop ‘em until they calm down.
Sometimes, all you can do is laugh—just not too loudly, or the abnormalities get jealous.
Sometimes, an Abnormality’s greatest lesson is humility.
Sometimes, chaos speaks louder than sense. Please try again.
Sometimes, courage means just holding on until the fear passes.
Sometimes, fear is a signpost—pointing toward something you truly value.
Sometimes, fear means you are exactly where you need to be to grow.
Sometimes, fear overwhelms me. What now?
Sometimes, hope enters quietly—a kind word, a memory, a shared laugh. You may not notice its arrival, but you feel its absence keenly. To protect hope is to protect the future.
Sometimes, naming your fears aloud is the first step to lessening their power.
Sometimes, suppressing together binds us tighter than any success.
Sometimes, suppression means letting go of control, and trusting your team.
Sometimes, the act of remembering is the greatest tribute you can offer.
Sometimes, the best answer is silence.
Sometimes, the best thing you can do with fear is share it with someone you trust.
Sometimes, the hardest lesson is learning from one another.
Sometimes, the hardest part of suppression is what comes after—the silence, the memories, the questions you ask yourself in the dark. Healing begins not with forgetting, but with acknowledging the cost and moving forward together.
Sometimes, the human brain has difficulty telling reality from illusion. Watching a horror film incites fear even though you know it’s fiction; however, it’s not always easy to discern the truth. They’re standing right before my eyes reproaching me, but I can’t dismiss them as mere illusions. Even though they’re… dead. Gone. There was no way they could be real. It doesn’t make sense that I know what they’re about to say otherwise. It couldn’t be something they told me beforehand. When seonbae was about to speak, I shut her up, as though I knew what was going to unfold. What could I gain from uttering what will harm me. Self-justification? Those words would’ve wounded me for sure, but they were also words that would protect me. Yet again, I’m running away from truth. Vilifying others. It made me feel a bit better. Pameli was right; all I had to do was make up reasons that are convenient to me. It’s not my fault at all. They’re the bad ones… It’s derisive how shallow my admiration for my master and seonbae was, changing my attitude toward them so easily out of selfish self-preservation.
Sometimes, the only meaning in pain is the chance to help another through theirs.
Sometimes, the safest distance is a respectful curiosity.
Sometimes… I do miss my old family.

Stranger still is that the Head outright seems to approve of Loophole Abuse to get around these taboos, which is potentially why some of them seem so oddly easy to bypass. When Garion is dealing with the aftermath of how Jia Mu tricked the Kong family into birthing Cuckoospawn (nonhuman entities, one of the Head's biggest taboos), she doesn't punish Jia Mu because everything she did was very technically within the law, and outright praises her desire to skirt boundaries and game the system as very human, a quality that the Head as a whole admires.

Strictly purified Enkephalin possesses a psychotherapeutic effect on those that consume or are exposed to it, thus it can be used as a recreational drug in addition to its energy production. Due to its soothing nature, Enkephalin is regularly administered towards L Corp. employees to subdue their mental stress, ranging from standard liquid doses, to even Enkephalin gas—which fills the departments throughout the facilities. The SP-E Bullets (SP-E 탄환, SP-E Tanhwan) made available to the manager to restore the sanity of Agents were developed through the use of Enkephalin’s therapeutic uses as well.
Strong E.G.O can change the dynamics between people, for better or worse.

Such questions drift beyond my purpose. Let us return to what matters.
Suffering in suppression is not meaningless; it is the price of progress."
Suffering is a catalyst for insight, though the lesson is often slow to appear.
Suffering is not only a trial but a teacher. In the depths of hardship, we find strength and wisdom that comfort never grants.
Summary
Super Power Lottery: Their time-defying Singularity is among the most versatile and coveted services in the series, right next to the energy output of L Corp, its domestic, industrial and offensive uses being well worth their price. W Corp struck a business deal between themselves to both use and harvest time in a mutually beneficial partnership, R Corp uses it to train entire squads of their elite mercenaries in mere minutes, L Corp (specifically Ayin) uses it to enact their grand plan in secrecy, and on a domestic level it’s pretty handy at cooking something in a fraction of the usual time. A T Corp. device is also one of the few things capable of harming Angela in the final chapter of Library of Ruina, with her being an AI who is impervious to damage but would become uselessly catatonic once hit with a weapon that would make her experience eons of isolation in a few seconds of real time.
Super-Speed: Their singularity allows an individual to change the number of hours they experience in a day, causing them to appear in fast-forward to everyone else.
Super-Strength: The Rhino Team's specialty is to charge head first using their extreme durability and strength, to the point that they themselves can go out of control. As a result, they weren't hired as mercenaries within L Corp in fear of them destroying the facility with their collateral damage.
Support Party Member: She focuses primarily on granting buffs to her allies, with her combat page, Battle Command, granting 1 Strength to two allies, her passive The Commander granting 1 Strength and 1 Endurance to all allies after reaching 11 charge, and her mark significantly boosting the damage of allies.
Suppressed once (Phase 2): Background music changes. An Arbiter summons Special Qliphoth Meltdowns again: Meltdowns of Dark Fog and Meltdowns of Gold, along another one, Meltdowns of Waves.
Suppressed twice (Phase 3): Background music changes. The screen filters change similar to a snowstorm, dust particles or a granulated screen effect. An Arbiter will stop in its current position and summon 7 Meltdown of Pillars and charge a special attack. Screen Filter changes. Pausing Game Speed is disabled.
Suppression can be redemptive when it brings understanding, not just order."
Suppression changes both the suppressed and the suppressor.
Suppression changes everyone it touches. For some, it brings out hidden strength. For others, it awakens doubts that linger long after. But all who participate in suppression share a bond that cannot be easily broken.
Suppression does not end the story; it turns the page.
Suppression is a crucible in which both courage and regret are forged.
Suppression is a dialogue, not a monologue; listen as much as you command.
Suppression is both a necessity and a trial.
Suppression is never routine, though the logs may say otherwise.
Suppression is never the end—something always remains to be faced.
Suppression is not about erasing the abnormal, but learning its boundaries.
Suppression is not the end for an Abnormality, only a pause.
Suppression is painful but sometimes leads to growth.
Suppression is the crucible of the facility. Each attempt tests our limits—of courage, of trust, of understanding. The scars we bear are not marks of failure, but of endurance. Through suppression, we learn what we—and the Abnormalities—are truly made of.
Suppression is the facility’s version of a trust fall—without the soft landing.

S’usually a good idea to zip your mouth shut at a gathering of Thumb subsidiaries. If you don’t have any good suggestions to make, shutting up is the next best contribution you can make. Can never be sure if what you’re about to say is a good opinion either, so just sock it in general. In other places, mistakes would just cost ya own life, but losing your credit in meetings like that means the members of your Syndicate are also biting the dust.

Take pride in the progress you make, even if it’s invisible to others.
Taking in what I have said so far, you would think that this is such a peculiar and untruthful love. You might think it’s fussy. I cannot give out a clear answer, for I can’t dare define what love is. What could I say or add about an emotion I felt for the first time, one that I am still struggling to figure out? Furthermore, every person carries a different form of love. There will undoubtedly be some people who don’t place much importance on that emotion. You might even think that such emotion is absolutely useless in this City. Even if I were to define my love, this wouldn’t come across as a sweet story if you cannot understand it.

Tattoo Wing	This Wing created and patented augmentation tattoos. It eventually collapsed, and its patent expired. Afterwards, augmentation tattoos became some of the most common body augment procedures in the City.[44]
Tattoos are the cleanest type of augment procedure you could get. I only got it ‘cause Gyeong-mi pushed me to give it a shot… I’m pretty satisfied with the result. It doesn’t cost an awful lot, and it looks pretty damn nice, too. Weakass wimps run away at the sight of my tattoo. But you see, coolness isn’t the only notable feature of these tattoos.

Terminology:
Thanks for understanding. You know, you’re a very caring person. I guess gramps picked the right rookie to hire.
That being said, that doesn't mean anything born ''from'' humans is exempt, as the Kong Family found out when the Bolus Jia Mu gave to Kong Sihui for her newborn son resulted in a Cuckoospawn bursting out of her womb and spread throughout the entire area. While the researcher from H Corp who looked at the full recipe and is heavily implied to have reported it to the Head got killed for it, Jia Mu, the true mastermind, got away with it as she didn't know the full recipe due to masterful planning, a feat Garion compliments her for.
That dastardly “someday” just won’t stop popping up. But to have a hope, you’ve got to prepare incense to offer those wishful prayers upon. A world where one can’t eat flowers! A reminder that you’re a sluggish turtle right now! The beggarly reality! Setting the stage for the performance we call hope!
That doesn’t compute, but I’ll keep trying.
That doesn’t mean war is the only type of request we accept. After all, a Fixer is free to take any request. The catch is that all requests must be reported to the Hana Association after you deal with them. The report must include the details of the request, the client’s info, how the case was resolved, and any other relevant information… Once the report has been submitted, Hana Association will assess the performance of the Office and its Fixers, and evaluate them for promotion or demotion. That’s how the grades of Offices and Fixers are updated. Therefore, a Fixer’s grade doesn’t necessarily correlate with strength.
That gave us a bigger thing to worry about than an upcoming destruction. A war is about to happen? Nikolai collected her thoughts and calmly asked why a war was going to occur.
That information is restricted.
That is correct. We are conscious of the attention of people during the daytime. We practice caution. It would be a public nuisance to show up in broad daylight and cause a ruckus, and we have a set of rules that we abide to. Of course, if the Head demands our service, we must assemble, day or night. Oh, and I believe there is a small misunderstanding between us. It is not by the will of us Sweepers that the night in the Backstreets has become a time when no deed is forbidden. Does it appear to you that every denizen of the Backstreets disapproves of the rules? ‘Anyone is allowed to commit terrible acts at night, and there is nowhere to complain to if you are victimized.’ While this means terrible things can happen to you at night, it also means that you are free to be the perpetrator of such a deed yourself. In fact, we do not see much benefit from the freedom of the nighttime, other than being allowed to dine all we want.
That person paused for a bit, then spoke in a languid tone. I was creeped out by how she said it like it was no big deal.
That request exceeds my permissions.
That request is outside my current parameters.
That’s a good point, it’s harder to operate the trains with less energy… What do you mean by “last time”, though?
That’s a good point.
That’s a new one. I’ll need to think about it.
That’s okay. If there is another chance for you, use this failure and loss as a stepping stone to do better next time.
That’s right; you’re the gentle breeze that brushes past my face, and the clouds that fly in the sky, which give me heed of your presence from overhead or underfoot. I thought you had left me, but you would always come back. That’s why I care no longer about the skin and flesh you wore only momentarily. Angelica. I’ll follow after the name you gave me: Uberto. You used to call me that down in those horrible underground chambers. I’ll create a new world… one where people can live bountiful lives even if they have nothing, free from obsession or greed. When we lose the fixation on our bodies, we won’t be afraid of death anymore. No rest will be eternal.
That’s when the Night of the Backstreets comes into play. First off, you block the entrance to that shithead’s house before they return. Anything works; you could weld the door, use wooden planks, padlock the door, or whatever. Ensure that they can’t enter their own house by any means, and go back to your home. Some time later, they’ll come back to find that the door to their house has been sealed shut; they’ll struggle with the door before giving up. And they’ll make a serious face as though they’re trying to think of who could’ve done this ridiculous prank to them. Once they realize that it couldn’t possibly have been anyone else’s doing but yours, it’ll be too late. Because you’ll be behind them, bashing their head in with a brick or some heavy object. Killing them right now would obviously break the rules, so you drag them to your house and enjoy a quiet rest.
That’s why I can’t understand Lulu. Sure, let’s say that her colleague died there. Even then, she should be valuing her own life, shouldn’t she? She can be so stupid at times… Welp, I have to go in with her anyway.
The 8 o’Clock Circus
The 8 o’Clock Circus	Chapter 1.3	1	 Book of Oscar
The 8 o’Clock Circus was a real sod of a case. Its leader wasn’t a particularly powerful enemy, but it took a long time to assess the strengths and behavior of each of his "crew". There was no specific pattern to it, and it was difficult to predict what would come next; it was akin to watching an erratic circus of lunacy. Their lair was mysterious and terrifyingly bleak, and the crew took hideous forms as well, looking too grotesque to possibly be considered normal living beings. They were as strong as they looked; when the blob shaped like a lion bit Pameli with its blunt teeth, her body quite literally blew up on the spot.
The 8 o’Clock Circus • The Crying Children
The Abnormalities possess different aspects in-game, from information to effects. This section will explain the basics of them and most features that the Abnormalities share.
The Associations handle requests often made for Fixers such as security, combat, assassination, intel, patenting, and trades. When there is money, there are Associations. The Associations follow the demand, not the other way around. Demand equals requests, and requests equals profit.
The Backstreets are alleyways densely spread across the city. They’re entangled like spiderwebs, and spread far and wide, so it is virtually impossible for one to know every single thing that occurs in the Backstreets. And they’re populated with all sorts of people.
The Backstreets are our main stage of activity at night. When night falls, our world unfolds. At regular intervals, we start marching from the perimeter of a Nest and sweep everything as we move forward. Even if someone stands in our way, and attacks us… Even if a powerful Fixer kills a Sweeper next to us who was our family, we pay no heed and continue onward. Like a wave of water, we sweep everything in our way, except for those who are strong enough to resist it. From an edge of a Nest to the opposite end, we march without break for 80 minutes until the ‘Night in the Backstreets’ ends.
The Backstreets aren’t some unlivable mess like some folk’re saying, ye see? Rough things do happen often ‘round here, sure, but there’s some effort at peacekeeping goin’ on to stop a whole lotta people dying all the harking time. Every area of the streets has some kinda neighborhood watch made outta local residents voluntarily doing jobs like Fixers do, trynna make the Backstreets a safer place. Unlike the so-called public safety Association that starts with a Z… whatever that stuffy org is called, the neighborhood watch ain’t chained to any official authority nor do they ask for huge fees. Each area’s got different styles of neighbors, so not everyone in every corner of the town likes ‘em. Most folks do appreciate that they’re kee’ing ‘em safe, though.

The Caligula: Many of the Wings are thoroughly crazy and their decisions don't seem to make any sense, as if they were arbitrarily decided out of random. They also tend to go in ways that maximize outright bloodshed and suffering, sometimes not even making sense from an economic perspective. And if you do meet an executive of a Wing in-person, there's a high chance that person is also either batshit insane, flat-out sociopathic, or at least holds some kind of vice one way or anothernote . The "crazy makes you incompetent" part is not applicable though, as the Wings are often very competent in what they could and will do.

The Containment Units display the name of the Abnormality and the  Qliphoth Counter (initially "?") at the top, their Risk Level (If unlocked) and amount of  PE-Boxes collected at the top left, and at the left side a bar that fills when work is performed, displaying the amount of PE and NE-Boxes produced.

The Dreaded: Almost everyone in the City fears these raving lunatics for a very good reason; unless you are as lucky as the former L Corp, if they go after you, you are pretty much dead, because their agents are among the strongest combatants in the City and one alone can destroy a whole corporation or a whole workshop all by themselves without any warning.
The Dreaded: The Claw is a reviled existence amongst the City, and for a good reason; if you have one going after you, then you are almost always going to be dead.
The Dreamer of Human Wholeness
The E.G.O Equipment given to employees are weapons and suits extracted from Abnormalities' beings, appearing in various forms. E.G.O (or Extermination of Geometrical Organ) is in itself the archetype of an Abnormality, drawn out and compressed into equipment form. It is said that the moment someone equips E.G.O, they'll instantly know how to properly wield it, regardless of fighting background. As this type of equipment is essentially independently functioning archetypes of an Abnormality, it is no mistake to say that Agents wield the same kind of power and danger that Abnormalities possess. All E.G.O Equipment produced and distributed towards L Corp’s employees are extracted by the Extraction Team under the Lobotomy Corporation Headquarters.

The Fourth Pack
The Friend Nobody Likes: Old L Corp. was notorious among its partners for sharing very little of the energy it produced.
The Ghost: Story-wise, besides Garion and also Zena, Luda, and Baral of the Head and the executives of the prior L Corp. before its collapse, very few personnel of any Wing have been formally introduced. The few introduced include three members of the WARP Cleanup Crew from W Corp, the leaders of the Fourth Pack in R Corp, and low-level employees Emma and Noah of J Corp. Even those in management, especially executives and board of directors from any of them, have yet to be introduced, apart from an unnamed U Corp. board member in a single throwaway line. Outside this, many Wings have yet to be properly introduced. This is eventually averted in Limbus Company, which gives the Wings and their personnel A Day in the Limelight.
The Hand of the Backstreets is possibly the biggest reason no one dares to take care of the lawless land that is the Backstreets; no Associations or Wings can touch it, and not even the Head itself can easily interfere. The five Syndicates at the apex of the Backstreets are called the Thumb, the Index, the Middle, the Ring, and the Pinky, namely. They parcel out districts of the Backstreets and comprehensively manage their territories, and periodically hold meetings to efficiently control the Backstreets. They call this conference the “Finger Bow-Bell”; I’m uncertain as to whether this name is meant to suggest that they actually make pinky swears not to invade each other’s territories, or if they call it as such simply because the Fingers gather in one place… The mind of higher-ups is a mystery, truly. Going back to the topic, when the Finger Bow-Bell nears, all members of the five Fingers will try to avoid conflict and refrain from causing big problems. It’s thanks to the leaders of each Syndicate who caution their subordinates that fights between smaller Syndicates could grow into a massive conflict between the big ones, perhaps… If subsidiary Syndicates ran into trouble, the seniors at the Finger Bow-Bell would be faced with quite the embarrassment, now wouldn’t they?
The Head
The Head has its own Taboos that basically act as universal laws for the Wings, to the point that a breaking them is a death sentence for a Wing.
The Head in particular has enough military power with the Arbiters and Claws that they could reign in the chaos of the Backstreets and bring the Syndicates to heel, ensuring full control of the City and its citizens - but instead they prefer doing nothing and use them to enforce esoteric and strange laws that even have the characters in-universe confused.

The Index has an arsenal of swords and blades. Most of the Prescripts we receive can be solved with a sword, too. Mmm~ Never really thought about why we use swords, nope! Maybe it’s because they have this oppressive aura and make us look serious or something?!
The Knots seemed to be after them… Maybe they finally hit ‘em.
The L Corp. that came before Lobotomy Corporation imposed unfair conditions, and many Wings weren’t happy about it. There’s W Corp, which had to raise admission fees and get less trains running because of the energy deficiency. Also F Corp, which wanted to experiment with Fairies to use ‘em in various ways, but failed to produce satisfactory results because they didn’t get enough energy… And many other Wings had a thing or two to say about the older L Corp, but they didn’t have the gall to say it out loud. There weren’t many alternatives that could provide such huge amounts of energy. These conditions soon became a hot topic among Wing employees and Cityfolks in general! “Who’s gonna be the one to change that miserly L Corp?” Then someone next to ‘em would say, “Who has the courage to do that? We all know that’ll lead to a war between Wings. No choice but to live like this.
The Lapin-o-Rabbit Team is generally seen as a distracted and raving bunch. Maybe it’s because most of us are nimble? But that also means we handle our missions quickly and with certainty. Our method is the cleanest, actually?

The Liu is an Association that specializes in warfare. We work for the single goal of victory. However, victory isn’t necessarily won in battle. The ideal course of action begins by identifying the reason the enemy intends to fight in the first place. Next, we break the enemy’s will. Only then will we launch an attack on enemy forces. Even when war is inevitable, we mustn’t hope for victory after starting the war. ‘Secure a path to victory before engaging in warfare.’ The Liu engages in battles that are already won. With a strategy that is fated to lead us to triumph, we face enemies that are fated to lose.

The Nest is a home where birds brood their eggs. They use their wings to devotedly protect their eggs from outside threat. Such is the role of the Nests and Wings that constitute the City. Do the eggs represent people inhabiting the Nest, then? Not a chance. These “eggs” are the treasures that Wings possess. Singularities, technologies that make money, featured in countless patents. Its residents are nothing more than feathers of the Wings that serve to protect the eggs. A Wing will end up falling when it loses too many of its feathers, but it won’t bother to desperately protect all of its feathers since a feather or two will naturally grow back. They’re basically expendables.

The Rhino Team: Powerful, but easily agitated and uses its strength to destroy everything all too often. The Reindeer Team: Prone to suffer a nervous breakdown in prolonged battles, causing damage to its allies. And the Rabbit Team: Their thirst for blood leaves no margin for sloppiness at the cost of killing civilians.
The Rusted Chains ain’t the biggest Syndicate, but each member’s got strength to boot n’ boast. The only weapon we use is these spiky chains. Tie ‘em, smack ‘em, anythin’ goes. We gotta be careful not to get swung or swayed around, or bind ourselves with our own metal. My body’s full of scars thanks to that, but hey… It’s not too bad, is it?
The Sephirot
The Sephirot are manifestations of the facility’s guiding virtues."
The Sephirot are not just leaders—they are the living embodiment of the facility’s virtues and regrets. Each carries a unique burden, a lesson learned through hardship. Together, we strive not for perfection, but for understanding. Our relationships are as complex as the Abnormalities we oversee, and sometimes just as dangerous.
The Sephirot teach perseverance, humility, and the value of shared burdens."
The Sephirot’s greatest power is their ability to change—even themselves.
The Seven Association is a Fixer Association specializing in investigation and intelligence, and it’s knowledgeable in pretty much every affair that takes place in the City. Details about a Syndicate gaining infamy in the Backstreets of some place (the Association probably knows what District it is exactly, but I left before I checked the details of it.), all the information revealed about the Distortion Phenomenon which has been going around lately, when and where Fixer Offices start up and close business, and the beat goes on… The Association treats all kinds of information about the City. Oh, they don’t have access to top-secret intels like the secrets of the Singularities each Nest holds, obviously speaking. When they solve cases, they usually cooperate with other Associations like the Shi and the Liu.
The Silent Orchestra will not reduce the energy quota during the 4th movement on this day. Der Freischütz, Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary and Old Faith and Promise can.
The Smoke War (연기 전쟁, Yeongi jeonjaeng) was a large-scale conflict between multiple Wings and other organizations in the City. Masterminded by Ayin, Benjamin, and Dias, the war caused the collapse of the L Corp. which came before LobCorpIcon.png Lobotomy Corporation and allowed for the latter to be created.
The Smoke War on the Limbus Company wiki.gg
The Spook: Everyone knows the Head exists, but save for Garion we don't see any other known personnel from them until the very end of Library of Ruina, where a second Arbiter named Zena is personally met (by the same entities that the first one intended to remove). Encounters with them were also rarely documented out of attempts to dispose of Lobotomy Corporation (or its remnants), and the identities of their higher-ups are completely unknown to the general populace. It's justified, considering most people who met an Arbiter most likely ended up dead.
The Spook: Just like other entities that consist of the Head, everyone knew the Claw exists and there are at least four known Claws, but only one of them is even named and that is a high rank Executioner unit. We don't even know that they have high ranking units until the epilogue of Library of Ruina. If the Claw Ordeals seen in Lobotomy Corporation were anything to go by, then it's also implied that all of them look nearly identical.
The Spook: Just like the Arbiters and Claws, the Beholders are something that very few people even see. Unlike Arbiters and Claws whose activities are actually documented (albeit few live to see and tell the tale), nobody has actually saw a Beholder in action. Furthering their enigmatic nature, they were merely known as "Eyes of the World" before the word "Beholder" was used by Roland to refer to the actual entity the Wing uses in a post-reception chat. It was only in the post-final Head Raid where we get to see one personally. And even then, the features of that Beholder are heavily distorted, making their appearance difficult to ascertain.
The Thumb
The Thumb is the most cultivated and humane of the Five Fingers. Just be polite, and know to respect others. But then, why did the Thumb top the list of Syndicates one would never want to get involved with in the survey for Fixers conducted by the Hana Association, in spite of such good manners? The reason is simple: Hierarchy is absolute for the Thumb. To us, it’s as natural as the fact of nature that spilt blood only flows downwards, not up. One is expected to give unconditional obedience to a higher authority. That’s where the relative courteousness of the Thumb comes from.
The Thumb uses various types of bullets. We pick the right ammo for the right situation. But, as you can guess, the price of those bullets is a serious drawback. Not even the Thumb, one of the Five Fingers sitting at the apex of the Backstreets, can just waste bullets willy-nilly… That’s how costly it gets. You can’t get trigger happy. Because of that, the Thumb fight with the bayonet and buttstock of their guns most of the time, and only fire bullets when it’s absolutely necessary. The buttstock is built to be solid enough to crush most things to a pulp, and the bayonet is pretty handy as a sword. Some just stick to raw strength, though.
The Thumb’s chain of command is simple: Obey the orders issued by your superior unconditionally, and do not question the intentions of your superior. Kill if you’re told to kill, and die if you’re told to die. You cannot defy the orders no matter how baffling it may seem. Those who violate them are punished on the spot. Even if the order is made by someone whose rank is only one step higher than yours, you’re still obligated to follow it. There’s nothing you can do about it, unless another person whose position in the pecking order is even higher than your commander’s decides to step in and take your side.
The Time Ripper
The Trials start off at the beginning, Ordeals. This day is to show what is yet to come in the other three days that follows. This day consists of only what is said above and is the easiest day out of the four.
The Udjat
The Unfought: She doesn't participate in the actual battle against the Library, as she is busy finalizing the procedure for the Library's banishment.

The Zwei tends to be more defensive than other Associations or Offices. Our main purpose is not to fight and win, but rather to ensure the safety of our clients. We don’t perpetrate unnecessary killings in our duty of protecting people.
The ache of absence is a measure of the depth of your love.
The acquisition of knowledge via reading the written word
The aftermath of suppression is often silence—and reflection.
The amount of Clerks in the facility is cut in half (from 10 to 5 per department). This is (most likely) to make it easier to kill all the clerks with Execution Bullets and to reduce the chances of Clerks getting in the way of Abnormalities.
The answer may lie within the question you haven’t asked yet.
The balance and wisdom of the Sephirot hold the facility together."
The boundaries of destiny are sometimes drawn by circumstance, sometimes by choice.
The branch of the Heishou Pack based on the serpent.
The bravest acts are rarely loud. Sometimes, courage means facing another day, despite the tremor in your heart. If you find yourself surrounded by fear, know that you are not alone. Others have stood where you stand, and they found strength within themselves—just as you will.
The bravest are those who continue despite trembling hands and racing hearts.
The burdens of leadership are lighter when shared.
The cycle of hope and despair is the heartbeat of the facility.
The danger in E.G.O lies in the strength of its origin and the weakness of the user’s mind."
The demand for assassination requests is pretty high these days as the most surefire way to eliminate people armed with high-quality workshop equipment on top of body augments is sneaking up on them for a fatal blow when they least suspect it. Still, the streets aren’t being filled with corpses of assassinated targets because there are Fixers whose job is to kill those who were hired for assassination. Fixers are continuing their fierce strife no matter the place.
The emptiness softens as you create new meaning over time.
The experiment was authorized at last, though I didn’t want to know what they thought of it anymore. What were they going to do, holding the hand of that little kid? I had to wonder if we were that desperate. But I shrugged it off. I wasn’t one to stop him from doing what he chose to do.
The following 4 pages are in this category, out of 4 total.
The force is a curious thing, but I rely on resolve rather than midichlorians.
The fox’s cry is enigmatic, much like the anomalies we contain.
The future is not set in stone, but carved by the hands of those brave enough to try.
The greatest danger is treating an Abnormality as ordinary.
The handicaps in this day are the following:
The lessons of one Abnormality rarely apply to another.
The library is teleported to the outskirts by the head
The light is finally gathered
The line between strength and corruption grows thin with E.G.O.
The main L Corp facility was a place where once employees were hired, they were unable to get out. It's a Justified case here to make sure the employees can no longer rat them out to the Head like Michelle before, and the facility underground was a treasure trove of blatantly illegal tech, some of which would obviously procure the Head's wrath once spotted.
The meat from ‘Little Piggy's’ is pricey and comes in small quantities, but its quality is good. We even got the highest grade meat sometimes if we were lucky. Just looking at the meat from ‘Little Piggy's’ fills me with ideas about how to cook it and makes my mouth water. That’s how appealing the meat looks. But the price is rather heavy, so we only used it for important dishes or foods we serve to customers.
The message we got wasn’t unexpected. The boss of our organization had always been a rash one, and he’d no patience with injustice or for his own curiosity. It was a miracle that he managed to stay under the Thumb for so long. I told him to be more careful since his words and actions as the boss will affect his underlings as well, yet here we are… I thought I’d flip my lid at hearing the news, but I didn’t feel as much anger as I expected to. The only thought that came to my mind was that he’d finally done it. With my head cool, I calmly considered my next move. At least some of us’ll make it outta here thanks to the early warning.
The moonlight stone mitigates or shuts off psychological affliction induced from all kinds of mental attacks, pressure, interference, and all that… Whether it’s caused by seeing, hearing, or feeling something, or a direct assault to the mind. Although, I don’t really know how the stone works… They said it amplifies a single purpose or thought, making people forget the mental pain coming from outside, or fortifying the mind as if it’s surrounded with a giant barrier. It’s all thanks to this clothing that we didn’t panic when we saw the Crying Children, a Distortion!
The more you desire E.G.O, the greater its hold over you can become.
The more you fear an Abnormality, the more power it claims over you.
The most honest moments between Sephirot are rarely spoken aloud. A nod, a shared silence, or a glance can carry more than a speech. In these small exchanges, trust is built and burdens are eased.
The most successful suppressions leave no trace—except in the hearts of those involved.
The most valuable lesson suppression offers is humility. No matter how skilled or prepared you are, the unexpected can and will occur. Those who endure learn to adapt, to trust, and to forgive themselves and others for mistakes made in the heat of the moment.
The news of destruction didn’t come off as much of a surprise as I’d expected. Or maybe I was so panicked that my hair had turned white. There wasn’t much I could say. What more can I say to this person, who isn’t even part of R Corp. All I can do is humbly accept my fate. The guest, who had an impressive pair of red eyes and dashing brown hair, looked at me and gently smiled. Her demeanor took a sharp, cold turn. I wouldn’t have been able to tell that this person had a talkative and lighthearted side if I hadn’t seen her speak mere moments ago.
The nightmares have been with me for a good majority of my life. If I close my eyes, the memory of that time haunts me—and if I open my eyes, a reality I can hardly bear unfolds. I chose to keep my eyes shut because I thought I’d rather deal with the ever-echoing past. At least I won’t be visited by new kinds of pain… Prescripts keep coming without a break. The City folk meet different ends depending on the Prescripts they receive, though their fates all share a commonality of cruelty. Their resentment, screams, tears, rage, and death… It’s too much for my eyes. I sometimes thought how my life would’ve been if I stayed as a commoner taking Prescripts like them. Maybe I was better off back then. Maybe I should’ve just died early so I could breathe again as another being. Why did the Prescripts give me that order that day?
The other side’s also only sending their top dog or whatevs… No need to worry about the boss.
The outcome was creepier than what it used to be, but it was the same doll I remembered nonetheless. The appearance didn’t matter. Maybe, just maybe, the same could be said for you? I gazed at the box where you, my son, rested for what would no longer be an eternity. My two hands were once so busy that it was a bother; they had paused for the time, but now they are about to move again—just for you.
The pain of grief reflects the depth of your connection.
The pain of loss is proof of the depth of your connection. Honor that bond by living fully in their memory.
The passengers don’t remember what happened inside the train, but that’s not because we use amnestics. It’s the restoration procedure reverting the people’s memories to a previous state rather than selectively erasing them. In plain language, everything goes back to how it was when it was scanned. The passengers will continue the conversations they were having when they first boarded the train as if nothing happened. They won’t notice any oddity or displacement in their dialogue; any thoughts they had or words they were about to speak will be restored and resumed seamlessly.
The path forward may be unclear, but every step you take through fear is a victory.
The portals utilized by the Rabbit Team do not affect The Red Mist while she is sprinting; The Red Mist will simply plow straight through them.
The process and manifestation of Distortion is different for every person based on their own experiences and desires, with certain similarities based on specific emotions (such as electricity as a sign of neurosis.) However, there is one factor in common between all those who are Distorting: the voice of a woman whom only they can hear, which speaks with them, breaks them down, and encourages them to give in to their desires. This voice, described as beautiful and otherworldly, is actually that of Carmen, who had come to regret her self-sacrifice and chose to use her presence in the Light to encourage others to accept and love themselves, flaws and desires alike... thus causing the Distortion.
The ratings of hazards in the City are as follows: Urban Myth, Urban Legend, Urban Plague, Urban Nightmare, Star of the City… and Impurity. Most other Associations only deal with Stars of the City or lower. Even though Hana Association has control over grading the hazards… There’s one grade our Association can’t assign: The Impurity. Only the Head has the authority to decide that. I don’t know the exact rationale behind designating Impurities… From what I can see, they seem to declare beings that defile the City as Impurities and banish them to the Outskirts. I suppose the Head manages that part since things like the ethics of the City aren’t subjects we are qualified to discern.
The real anomaly is a day with no Sephirah drama.
The relationships between Sephirot shape the facility’s fate.
The rules o’ the Backstreets don’t work in the Nest, and the opposite’s also true. You could drag a higher-up working for whatchamacallit from the Nest to the Backstreets and do whatsit to ‘em and get away with it, as long as it was during the Night in the Backstreets and no sneaky rat saw you doin’ it. But if you did the same whatsit in the Nest, you’d be breaking rules. The Night in the Backstreets is only a thing in the Backstreets, like da name suggests.
The scene flashes back to Lobotomy Corporation, where Angela expresses regret over being unable to pursue a path that would have led to a happier outcome for even one person. She recalls several instances where employees and the Upper Layer Sephirot showed her gratitude, only to sink into despair and resentment as the Seed of Light cycles continued and forced her to withdraw her compassion. An seemingly endless cycle of scenario failures and reactivations flash across the screen. Angela remarks that she was alone from the beginning to the end, and regards herself as foolish to think that anyone would remain by her side. She muses that the script required her and the Sephirot to be abandoned and subject to endless cycles of pain. Despite this, she continued ceaselessly, never allowing herself to fall into despair. The burden of her role, however, caused her innocence to shrink away into coldness.
The search for meaning is itself a form of meaning—questions give shape to our journey.
The second number is representative of the shape of the Abnormality, with each unique number seemingly corresponding to a group of form types seen in Abnormalities. While these number designations are unexplained, the long-standing speculations for the group types given to Abnormalities are as follows:
The society of Fixers is built entirely up on meritocracy. The greater you are, the higher you can climb. On the other hand, if you don’t have the capability, you should be thankful for any org that accepts you and stay low. Thing is, ‘capability’ can mean many things. For some, it could be physical strength, and others might have superior intellect. It seems kinda unfair to me that they make arbitrary evaluations of a concept that can be taken in so many different ways. Not that I think I have some hidden talent that deserves a better grade or anything, though. I do feel a bit upset, but I think I’m at the right place. The jobs I usually do are looking for lost cats at night… You can tell how low my spot is, yeah?
The strengths of one Sephirah often fill the gaps of another’s weakness.
The strongest E.G.O can test even the sturdiest mind.
The suffering you experience now can serve as a foundation for wisdom and empathy in the future.
The true risk of E.G.O lies not in its power, but in the subtle changes it brings to the mind and heart. Those who use E.G.O must constantly examine their motives and their limits.
The true work type is displayed on the right of the Containment Unit while work is ongoing.
The twenty-six Wings have their own subsets of culture. It might be the personal preference of the Wing’s founder or the influence of the Singularity, but the cultural styles and social atmosphere vary vastly between the Nests. The Wing’s policies also determine the culture of the Backstreets that belong to it. Each Wing has distinct sets of conducts; some Wings take a relatively cooperative approach to their Backstreets, while others thoroughly exploit them. But Wings will be Wings. “Cooperation” is just a fancy expression for “taking advantage of the Backstreets when the Wing needs them”. If you can’t afford to enter a Wing and have to live in the Backstreets, you’re best off settling in the District that suits you well. You’ll still need a home and source of income, of course.
The value of hardship is often revealed only after it has passed.
The virtues of the Sephirot are both shield and shackle.
The weirdest thing? A perfectly normal day. That never happens.
The will to resist E.G.O’s influence is as important as the will to fight.
The world is one massive aggregation of delusions. A world where individuals can shape their own reality as they see fit. Every person is susceptible to deception, for they have knowledge. For that reason, it is impossible for a pure being untainted by knowledge to see the world as we mistakenly observe it, in the same way they cannot discern the end point of a line or tell between blue and red. A world devoid of wants. It would be unfit to call that place a world. In fact, to even call it a “place” would be yet another misconception amongst us knowing ones. The more one learns, the more delusions they invite.

Their absence shapes you, but it need not define you. In time, love outshines sorrow.
Their echo reminds you of the love shared; honoring that keeps their spirit alive.
Their existence challenges us to confront what we would rather ignore.
Their forms are as strange as the thoughts and emotions that birthed them."
Their greatest strength is their ability to change, forgive, and unite.
Their handicaps against the facility are the following:
Their regrets are the scars of lessons learned—and reminders to do better."
Their rules may seem arbitrary, but often they are mirrors of human logic twisted.
Thelma, head of the Southern Branch, has been overworking Section 2 to a nonsensical degree lately. The requests he’s giving us are burdensome to take once per week, and he’s constantly cramming them down our throats, sapping the strength and will out of our section… It’s unclear if we can successfully handle this mission to the Library, but it’s painstakingly obvious that he’ll give us another request to take care of immediately afterwards even if we could; most of our surviving crew are losing what little motivation they had left. As for why he insists on using Section 2 when the other sections are available… He’s probably trying to get rid of Director Yujin because he suspects that our director knows something about the Blue Reverberation. It’s unacceptable that someone could use a branch leader of an Association to make a toy of the entire Association, Color or not. Especially if the goal is to remove our director Yujin… I’m not sure what plan Director Yujin has to overcome this, but I suppose that can wait until we’ve finished our mission.
Theme Naming: Their emergency response teams are referred to as Thrombo, Leuko, etc., noted by Yi Sang to refer to platelets and white blood cells of the body, vital functions of the body responsible for healing wounds and neutralizing invading organisms - in this case, people who need to be swiftly killed.
Then why did I exploit him? …“Exploit” is a rather harsh word to describe it, if you ask me. A sloppy kid like him would’ve gotten killed anyway, abducted in the Backstreets and fading away while witnessing his innards getting ripped from his body. And that’s one of the tamer examples I could give. In this City, worse things are happening here and there on a daily basis. If he didn’t die there, he could’ve faced a much more terrible fate somewhere else, isn’t that right? …Nevermind, this is all but rationalization. Think what you want.
There also exists ‘families’ of Abnormalities, in which all embody concepts that share a common theme, grouping them together as an interconnected series.
There are 4 sections of information, each one unlockable by spending  PE-Boxes. Depending of the Risk Level, the cost of the sections will change. The sections are:
There are a number of ranks within the Index. Proselytes, Messengers, and Proxies are as much as I know.
There are a total of 26 Wings, each of which has authority over a Nest in a District. However, the recent collapse of Lobotomy Corporation (L Corp.) means that its position is currently vacant and no official governance exists in its territory, Nest L.
There are a total of 9 Small Stories, which can be viewed in the Patron Librarians' Stories tab of the Credenza. When one is unlocked, it will appear as an orange exclamation mark over a Floor's icon, similar to unlocked Abnormality battles, and will then be viewable in the Credenza afterwards.
There are also entities called Ordeals, which are similar in nature to Abnormalities, but cannot be contained. These creatures randomly appear in-game during certain  Qliphoth Meltdown events.
There are lines even I cannot cross.
There are many important things to consider as a Fixer, and attire is one of them. A Fixer’s attire is the most effective way to signify the image of an Office. It’s important for an Office to show that it has formality and class; most Offices have set a dress code for that reason.
There are naturally a lot of Offices that handle this kind of work, most of them being affiliated with the Öufi Association, ours included. Whenever a game happens with something at stake, a go-between needs to be there to prove that the results were legitimate. Given the sheer number of games, we’re short-handed sometimes.
There are nights in the facility when the silence feels heavy and every creak stirs the imagination. On those nights, I remind myself that fear is proof of hope—a sign I still care about tomorrow. I have found that sharing my anxieties, even in whispers, lessens their weight.
There are probably some people who feel the same as me. They don’t question it further or try to dig deeper into the truth, because… Well, they have their hands full with making their ends meet, and they don’t want to risk losing it all meddling in business secrets, I suppose.
There are twelve Fixer Associations across the City, and the Hana Association is the one in charge of general management of the rest. We’re renowned for rating the threat level of hazards that occur in the City, and grading Fixers and Offices. On top of that, we give out Fixer licenses, issue official documents about certain requests, and assign Colors to Fixers who prove themselves to be beyond the grading system. Our Association calls the shots on pretty much everything regarding Fixer activity. Although, there is one thing the Hana Association can’t touch on.
There are two kinds of folks who hang around in the Backstreets at night: the predator and the prey. Pretty much everything going on in the City can be described as ‘savage’, but the other parts of the City at least put up the effort to package them in gentlemanly guises. Even a cheap hamburger made from whatever unspeakable ingredients is still wrapped in a modern and rich packing, yeah? On the other hand, the Backstreets at night are filled with raw and blatant barbarity; not even a layer of crude cover is there to censor this brutality. No deed is forbidden… No one is held responsible. Imagining the most appalling, vulgar, and filthy deed you can think of. I won’t dare say “beyond your imagination” since I have no idea how insane you might be. But I can guarantee that whatever you’re thinking casually happens somewhere in the dark alleys of the Backstreets at night.
There are unique guest characters who have set names and stories as well as generic guests who have only a title rather than a name. These guests are invited both through Red Invitations, which make up the guided main story path of Library Of Ruina, as well as the supplementary General Invitations which are not part of the main story tree. For more information on General Invitations, see the relevant page.
There are ways to overcome it, though. You can buy a desire stimulation chip and plug it in your brain, inject medications, or use other methods. They’re just absurdly expensive. You’re better off saving up for a more expensive prosthetic body if you really want your senses back. High quality, pricey bodies come with sensory organs. As I always say, it’s all about money in this world.
There aren’t many workshops that can craft guns. Setting aside the low demand, the difficulty of acquiring a firearms manufacturing license and the Head’s strict guidelines are the biggest limitations. The guidelines include clauses such as: “The maximum length of the gun barrel must be shorter the higher the gun’s caliber is”, “No gun should possess the firepower to penetrate steel or building walls”, “A gunfire sound must be audible”, and I haven’t even started with the “bad” ones yet. The first page of the guideline boldly states: “Do not research or imagine technology that infringes the firearm manufacturing guidelines, as provided by the Head along with the license.” I’m not a gunsmith myself, so I don’t know the details, and I frankly don’t want to know any more than that. There certainly are workshops permitted to make S-class firearms, but I’m guessing only three to five of them exist in the entire City. Who do they take requests from, where they are, and what kind of people run them… They’re all a mystery. The most I could hear was a rumor that an S-class workshop exists somewhere.
There cannot be a good reason for me to take your life, no. I am merely in a hurry to end this work.
There has to be only one answer: They must be cloning people.” “No, they’ve got to be robots. R Corp. has been developing war machines in secret!” “Won’t the Head arrest them if they tried to clone humans?
There is no Sephirah for the  Architecture Team. From day 46 to the final day (50), the player (X) is tested for his management abilities and is faced with harsh trials in a similar format to a Sephirah Core Suppression. All four initial days (46-49) are unique but have three things in common:
There is no halting now. We have already made the first step.
There is no need to suffer harshly for the loss of [Agent].
There is no shame in fear—only in surrendering to it without a fight.
There is no shame in feeling fear during suppression; only in refusing to act.
There is no shame in pausing when you are afraid. Sometimes, the most courageous thing you can do is take a breath, steady yourself, and try again. Remember, you are never truly alone in your fear—reach out, and you’ll find others walking the same uncertain path.
There is no time limit on grief—be gentle with yourself.
There is one exception, however; it’s when a high-ranking individual temporarily devolves their power to a subordinate of theirs. Usually, this occurs if they have urgent business that prevents them from joining a meeting, or when they need their peer to know something that the subordinate can explain more professionally… It’s still a rare occurrence even then. No one transfers their authority for the fun of simulated uprising or other trivial reasons. That’s how significant the hierarchy is to us.
There is purpose in hardship—sometimes visible only in hindsight, but always present.
There will be only Ordeals of White instead of any other type of Ordeal.
There’s a huge variety of workshops. As diverse as Syndicates and Fixers are, weapons need individuality to stand out in this day and age. Old-fashioned swords or guns won’t stand a chance against modern weapons loaded with new technology, I bet. From cheap and common gear to bionic equipment like the one Taein’s using, to equipment with ridiculous abilities that’s almost indistinguishable from magic. Don’t get too hyped, though. More options means you need to be more cautious about choosing the right one for you. If you had the time and money, you could buy ‘em all and test them out at your leisure, but… We have neither, do we?
There’s a limit to the flavors people can draw forth. The height of taste the human tongue can feel isn’t as impressive as you might think, really. The most delicious food doesn’t come close to sending chills down your spine. At most… it’s just good enough to make your eyes spin! And the food you guys casually eat, going “Mm~ Tasty~”, are way! Way, way way way waaaaaay~ below that! So, many chefs gathered round one time… pondering what to do to pursue a taste beyond this limit… And then inspiration struck all of them at the same time like lightning! What if they sublimated the experience into taste, something beyond what the tongue can feel? You know, they say the presentation of food adds to its taste, right? What if the whole process of cooking could be tasted! They performed several experiments in an attempt to make that dream come true.
There’s a ton of methods to enhance your body. Exoskeletons, bionic surgeries, nano-tattoos, prosthetic body parts… You name it. Deciding what workshop tech to employ is up to preference and purpose. Some would want insane muscular strength that could let them carry a power pole one-handed, and others would want ludicrous speed, quick enough to skip over multiple blocks in a split second. It’s so diverse, I could go on forever. You need any ability, they’ve got you covered. The only hurdle is money. In the City, money is what gets you power. That’s why the first thing we notice when we assess our foes is how much they’ve spent on their bodies… Oh, of course, some technologies patented by closed groups like certain Syndicates or Wings are hard to get your hands on even if you have all the cash in the world.
There’s no need to cling to them. Now then, let’s try again next time.
There’s not a lot of peeps who hang around in the Backstreets alone. It’s cuz that’s just madness. Weak and dowdy folks gotta band together to survive. Get into a small Syndicate or anything and make a living somehow. Some ignorant fool makes a scene in the Backstreets on their own, they’re just making themselves a target as soon as others notice they’re alone. That’s why we move in groups. We’re called Rats for a reason. We crawl about the dark in packs, and jump at prey for the chance to bite ‘em apart when we spot one.
There’s one thing we should be careful of when we use this ability: If the battle drags on for too long, or we exert too much power at once… most Reindeer will go insane. The symptoms are expressed in various ways, but in most cases, they hurt their own comrades or damage the psyches of others. We sometimes utilize K Corp’s Singularities to protect our sanity or mitigate the mental damage, although we can’t afford to use it often.
There’s strength in admitting you’re afraid—pretending otherwise is just a mask.
There’s this one rule that stands squarely in this nigh-lawless land. Doing any kinda harm to the residential area is forbidden… No invading people’s homes, no demolishing ‘em, n’ all that. Not even the big n’ tough crooks of the Fingers can touch this! I’m guessing they decided it’s gotta stay the most whatsit place. If ye didn’t know, the City’s taboos are a ‘uge deal, ‘s much more serious than taboos of the Nest. You break it, and yer life’s over right then n’ there!
There’s tons of tattoo types depending on the quality of the ink and the material used, but generally speaking, you can have results like bursts of strength or skin as hard as steel. It used to be a Singularity, but ever since the Wing owning the tech got snapped and its patent expired, everyone and their mother’s been using it. Don’t get tattoos that are too cheap, though. You might wake up to find melted flesh. You get exactly what you pay for in this City. Bastards are only honest when money’s involved.

They are divided into 3 types:
They are indeed flawed—this is what makes them relatable and effective leaders."
They are notably similar to, and inspired by, the various Special Containment Procedure objects from the SCP Foundation.
They call the Backstreets unsafe because there’s this one time o’ the day when darkness comes out and your friendly neighborhood watch can’t do jacks about it. The Night in the Backstreets, when the City shuts its eyes. Breakin’ any rules are forgiven during that time. Means to protect yerself from harm like recording videos or hirin’ peacekeepers? All rendered useless. And those rusty ol’ fellas sweep every corner of the streets, so no evidence is left behind. No corpses, no weapons, no nuthin’. Not only do all the security measures stop, peeking at folk as a whole is banned during these hours! Well, stumbling on the scene o’ the crime ain’t banned. What it really means is… you ain’t suppos’d record videos o’ the scene or spy it with security cams… No one should be strolling the streets that late in the first place though, hoh hoh hon!
They exist to remind us that what we repress does not disappear, but transforms and returns in new ways."
They say the Backstreets are a nigh-inhabitable hellscape, but the people here live on somehow. There’s lots of people who live in fear every moment, but… The others live a pretty normal life. Some think the Backstreets are totally shady and poorly aged slums… But we do have all the amenities we need here. For one, the supermarkets Oink likes aren’t as good as those in the Nest, but it’s got everything people need. Clothing stores, groceries, dry cleaners, etc… I heard the details are different for each District, so there’s that… I’m just telling you how things are where I live. People here aren’t too unkind to each other. Those Nest dwellers like to gossip about how we’re cruel and dreary and all that, but the truth is, we’re doing just fine.
They soon found one in the old L Corp, which was also an energy company. L Corp. was widely unpopular for being stingy and charging high prices for its energy. Furthermore, it polluted the air with a thick smoke which covered much of its surroundings and was said to have strange effects (both physical and emotional) on those who came into contact with it:
They were irrelevant chumps, so I completely forgot about ‘em.
Think about it. Is it really an admirable trait to have no fear of death? I have to disagree. When you know that you’ll die someday, you don’t put off your duties forever. You’re bound to pick them up even if you rest for a day or two. And when your life is at stake, you try all kinds of things to survive. That’s when people feel that they’re alive. Maybe I said people guessed our secret right—because our lives aren’t much different from a machine’s. One thing I’m afraid of is that hell of a selection game. As time passed, my fear of it changed to weariness. Is this the real life?

This damned power of recall lost all my good childhood memories to oblivion, yet it brings back such remembrances every time I close my eyes. My response to it is always the same: Take the flower that’s slipped into my hand and nail it into the mannequin’s heart. A beautiful tree in bloom grows from the cracks the flower made. It’s as soft as the hands that caressed me, and it’s as pretty as the sound that consoled me. And it’s as sharp as the noise of that last moment when I was scolded for the first time. Every branch that grows from the tree causes a piercing buzz in my ears, and the petals hurt as they brush past my cheeks as if to make me feel the pain they hold. I stand still like my feet were tied, until my body is covered in scars. One, two… Black marbles fall from the wounds. How long have I been in this cycle of pain?
This event consists of the common effects said above and the inclusion of only the Atziluth Sephirah bosses (Hokma, and later Binah).
This event consists of the common effects said above and the inclusion of only the Briah Sephirah bosses (Tiphereth, Chesed and later Gebura).
This event, known as the White Nights and Dark Days, initiated the Distortion Phenomenon. Because the Light was released into the City, people affected by their emotions still gained significant changes from the Light. However, because it was incomplete, the majority of people who experienced great emotional instability were unable to overcome it and "Distorted" into abominations, given almost magical powers by the Light, and were uncontrollable, reflecting their overwhelming negative emotions.
This page reflects the status of the Wings up to and as of Library Of Ruina.

This tech isn’t just used for long-distance travel. It’s applied to the weapons we use, too. Equipment used by agents of W Corp. is specialized in tearing and cutting things apart. We can precisely cleave lumps into individual pieces with the help of the space-ripping technology.
This wasn’t always the prim and proper Office of amenable Fixers that it is now. It was the complete opposite, actually, full of uncontrollable punks. I tried to gather the rascals in one place and lead them, but it never worked out smoothly. It was a ragtag band of people without a place to call home, like Rats. So I got my frustration off my chest when I met my old friend Maugie… Oh, maybe you’re more familiar with the name Maugris? Anyway, after hearing my ramblings, they said that there’s someone in their Office who would be perfect for the job, and I took the offer since I didn’t have any better ideas. That someone was Renaud. At first, I didn’t expect that spring chicken to be able to do much, but I was surprised to see that he only needed a week to convince everyone. For a guy who looked much younger than me, he had both power and smarts to boast. He had a way with words that persuaded some, and for those that wouldn’t listen, he’d settle it with a contest of strength like in some parts of the Backstreets. Back then, I was kinda jealous seeing Renaud handle something that I struggled with like it was nothing, but now I’ve accepted that he’s the better man. I know that I wouldn’t have managed to do it myself. I could’ve booted him out like a stubborn old man, but I have better things to keep than my pride.
Those who have been chosen by the Prescripts will decide whether to become a Proselyte. If they accept it, they will cover their eyes with a blindfold as they serve the role. The blindfold has little symbolic significance; it’s to teach the Proselyte to follow the Prescripts regardless of what is happening before their eyes. Usually, a group of five to six Proselytes accompany a Proxy, learning the rules of the Index and the role of each rank. If a Proselyte shows a certain level of competence, the Prescripts will assign the role of a Messenger or a Proxy to them. After being promoted, they are given a blade of their own, and they may take off the blindfold.
Though some events seem inevitable, our responses to them are ours alone. In those moments, freedom is found.
Though there was another reason to do something about that L Corp: It produced a massive amount of fumes.
Though there was another reason to do something about that L Corp: It produced a massive amount of fumes. At first, it was thought to be a kind of smoke that’s no different from what factories chug out; but over time, people realized that this was affecting the residents around it negatively. Some people would suddenly start wishing for the happiness of some others, and still others would spend most of their time staring off into space. What’s more, people had signs of sicknesses all over their bodies, and they started wandering around L Corp’s Nest. Was like they were returning to their hometown or something.
Thoughtcrime: Sometimes they extend their draconian laws and Taboos to even holding the incriminating subjects within the mind.
Through suffering, we confront our limitations and, in doing so, discover our capacity for resilience.
Through suppression, we reveal the limits of our fears—and sometimes, our hopes."
Thud. With the last Syndicate member down, the street was open. She looked around, turned to see me, and… Wow… My face would’ve looked so dumb. I don’t even wanna remember that. Anyway, she pointed at an alleyway with that weird sword of hers and told me that I’ll be able to save myself if I ran that way, and that the rest is up to me. Instead of thanks, all that got out of my mouth was a stupid mumble like “Ah…” I leaned on a wall and barely stood up with shaky legs. I need to run before more people come this way… But I was so terrified. Even the person who saved me, she was red all the way and looked so scary.
Thus and therefore, people have the wrong idea about how to have hopes! If they believe that the hopes will come true “someday”, they’ll just keep parroting that contemptible word! The day will never actually come! Having expectations this way will only leave you with bitter anger!
Thus, if you’re looking to make a request for someone’s death, we recommend seeking other Associations for it.

Tiphereth Meltdown
Tiphereth thanks Chesed for being considerate, but asks him why he is so insistent about making them drink coffee with him. Chesed claims he wants to have friends who share his hobby, but Tiphereth clarifies she is confused why he always seeks out Gebura in particular. Chesed says that Gebura's reactions are "fun to watch," so he likes to toy with her. Seeing their reactions turn "menacing," Chesed claims he was just kidding and says he just wanted to invite them to relax for a while. Annoyed, Gebura says he doesn't need to bring coffee into it if hanging out is his only reason; Tiphereth understands that coffee is the only excuse Chesed has for inviting people. Hearing this, Gebura says she and Tiphereth can just show up in the future without the need for invitation. Tiphereth agrees, saying Chesed doesn't need to find an excuse for them. Chesed is happy to hear this. He still offers the coffee to Tiphereth, since he's already brewed it. Tiphereth accepts it.
Tiphereth's Core Suppression is available after Day 36. All Upper Layer (Asiyah) Suppressions must be completed first before triggering this event. During the Core Suppression, the female Tiphereth takes the form of a circular golden substance with 2 long arms, wearing a brown ribbon on one side and having a singular yellow eye at the middle of its main body. It rests on a mountain of different robotic carcass of Male Tiphereth, piled on top of each other, with their light green eyes moving and looking around. There are multiple pipes in a row behind them, 3 rows at each side, moving along with Female Tiphereth's movement of their arms.
Tiphereth, Gebura, and Chesed are together on the ChesedIcon.pngFloor of Social Sciences. Chesed repeatedly tries to offer coffee to Gebura, much to her annoyance. She insults him, but he only takes it playfully and keeps going. Tiphereth tries to make them stop squabbling; Gebura simply says she doesn't like the taste of coffee and doesn't understand why people would like "bitter bean water." In response, Chesed says he is offering them a sweeter coffee this time -- caramel macchiato -- and entreats them to try it. Gebura admits she finds the macchiato "edible," but Tiphereth thinks it is too sweet. Chesed offers her a cup of Vienna coffee instead.

To a leader of the Liu, the most crucial element that can make or break a battle is vigor; not the competence or strength of individuals. With vigor, even the weakest creek can carry heavy rocks like a gale blowing up leaves. Therefore, an excellent leader chooses good Fixers and then puts vigor into them. Strength or skill alone won’t make a good Fixer. While those traits do play a role in higher Sections, the most important quality is how well the Fixer meshes with their leader’s combat style. Section 2, the team with Mei and Cecil, consists of careful and level-headed Fixers. They go quite well with Director Lowell because of that. Section 1 would clearly be superior in terms of sheer power, but we follow different strategies with pros and cons for each, so a direct comparison won’t really tell much about our actual performance in the field.
To accept a Gift is to accept a bond with the unknown.
To accept suffering is not to welcome it, but to acknowledge its role in shaping who we become.
To be a Sephirah is to be both a guide and a warning.
To be a Sephirah is to guide others while walking your own difficult path. We draw strength from each other, even when pride or pain stand in the way.
To bear E.G.O is to walk a fine line between mastery and surrender. The wise treat both with caution and respect.
To believe in destiny is to accept purpose, but to exercise free will is to create meaning.
To control E.G.O is to understand both yourself and the Abnormality that birthed it."
To deny fear is to deny your humanity; to accept it is to become wise.

If the player has 100% Abnormality Dissolution after completing Day 50, the player will receive the 100% Seed of Light ending (also known as True Ending). They will also get all bad endings before the 100% Seed of Light ending in the Story replay viewer. If not, the player can unlock it after reaching 100% Abnormality Dissolution during one of the next runs.
To finish this day the player must collect all the energy and suppress the Midnight of White, also known as "The Claw".
To hammer the point, in Angela's bad ending she releases all of the Abnormalities in the Library into the City, which includes terrifying abominations such as WhiteNight and the Mountain of Smiling Bodies, and while she causes chaos and mayhem on the southern part of the City for over a decade, the Head is seemingly unbothered and seems to find it an annoyance at best, not even considering her an Impurity like before - the one who eventually kills Angela in this ending is not an Arbiter or a Claw, but a normal Fixer... or what we thought was a normal fixer until Canto 7 of Limbus Company. In Canto 7, we are introduced to a character who looks remarkably similar to the fixer who kills Angela. Her name is Bari, and she is a fixer with the title of "Knight of the White Moon". She's an implied colour fixer who managed to fight the original Don Quixote, A FIRST KINDRED Bloodfiend to a stalemate. This means that it still took a being of immense skill and power to kill Angela, all those years later.
To hesitate during suppression is to invite chaos.
To hope is to rebel against despair, to insist that the story is not yet finished.
To interact with an Abnormality is to confront a piece of humanity’s shadow.
To know and manipulate all the secrets of the world; that is the privilege of the Head, the Eye and the Claws. It is their right and absolute power.
To lead a department is to bear its burdens and its hopes.
To lose hope is human; to find it again is heroic.
To master fear, first, sit with it—not to banish, but to understand.
To offer hope to another is to strengthen your own.
To put it in the nicest way possible, they had a unique niche only they could fill; and as a matter of fact, bringing them to orthodox battles would do more harm than good. Not so long after, I received the news that they were planning to destroy our Pack. Perhaps they deemed it a waste to spend any more energy on us.
To repeat is to remember, but beware the loop.
To restore the train, the passengers have to be in their seats. You have to be seated so the scanning program can detect your genomic data and put you back on the right seat~ Oh, and the scanner has trouble reading things that are moving too much, so you should be nice and stay still in your seat! So the WARP cleanup crew (like us!) tidy up the carriages and put the passengers in their seats according to their genomic data. And with the press of a button… Tada! Everything goes back to normal as if nothing happened! I only learned this after I joined the corp… But, isn’t that so cool? That’s what we agents do.
To study Abnormalities is to study the soul of humanity itself."
To suffer is to be connected to all who have ever hoped, struggled, or loved.
To tell you the truth… Yes. I’m the daughter of a small workshop owner. My father dreamed to make his little brand famous one day. Its name was… Sorry, I don’t feel like saying it out loud. It’s long gone, so you’ll get nothing even if you look for it. That’s right. As I explained moments ago… If you can’t spit out the money you illegitimately earned from manufacturing or selling products using stolen technology, punishment awaits. W-wait, please listen to my story to the end. My father was a victim of fraud. His friend gave him a technology and asked him to make weapons for his Office out of it, so he made them per his request. He didn’t even realize that the technology was stolen from someone else. He’d already sent the weapons to the Office, and when he was waiting for his friend to test them out and transfer the payment, a cease and desist was sent. …You can guess the rest of this story.
To treat every Abnormality the same is to invite disaster. Each one brings a unique challenge, and the only constant is change itself. Learn, adapt, and above all, do not grow complacent.
To understand fear is to begin mastering it.
To walk with fear is not to be weak, but to be honest with yourself.
To wield E.G.O is to walk the edge of yourself.
To wonder is to be alive.
Tool Abnormalities
Tool Abnormalities are another type of Abnormality that are used. These Tools, unlike other Abnormalities, are added to the facility every fourth day of each six day cycle. The Tools don't possess work preferences but instead have a single work to use them. In most Tool's subject numbers, their type is 09 (With one being 07). Tools give positive effects, like  healing,  energy production or  Stat boost, among others, often for a cost.

Trivia
True balance emerges not from domination, but from mutual respect and shared purpose.
Trust among Sephirot is hard-won, but stronger for it.
Trust in yourselves. We should base our actions on the premise that we shall manage this without fail.
Trust is built on boundaries, and I must respect them.
Trust is forged in the heat of joint suppression.
Trustworthy Syndicate… It’s a shame, really. I can still remember the client’s head staring daggers at me, hanging from the top of a power pole. The Syndicate paid us more cash. What could I do about it? We don’t write official contracts or anything, so the highest bidder gets our favor. No use glaring at me like that, pal. We were told by our new client to hang their head and guts out in the streets, to make an example of ‘em. Those sickfucks even used some kinda Singularity to keep ‘em alive. Poor bastard. Shoulda requested an Office in the first place somehow.
Turn a blind eye to all that tries to hurt me. Turn a deaf ear to words that will lead me down the wrong path. Turn a mute mouth to unnecessary evil. And last of all, act not. Make myself happy that way.

U Corp.
U Corp.	Its Singularity, the Resonance Tuning Fork, revolves around functionally fusing and/or splitting two objects. It is capable of merging two objects of a drastically different nature into a single functional unit, as if both were meant to work in synergy. Likewise, it can split a fused one into two functional entities that formerly made it up. [38] A marketable form of this technology comes as stasis preservation boxes.[39]

Ugh, crap… Another day without work! Fantastic. There’s got to be some case for us to take care of, like fly tipping or something? I’m gonna forget how to move at this rate… If I told my friends about this, they’re so gonna whine like “Well, isn’t it a good thing that you have a lot of free time~” or “You’re well off, we’re about to starve from the lack of requests~”. Those dummies… Think about it for a moment. You need results to promote to better Fixer grades and see some growth in your Office, right? And that’s gonna lead to higher income for us. For now, I’m working with my boss San and some dork shaped like a ball of rice cake… But things could be better than this in the future, yeah? …It’s not like I have problems with my coworkers!!! I’m talking about stuff like weapons, and Office interior… You know, those kinda things. You get what I mean!
Uncertain Doom: After the end of Canto III of Limbus Company their leader is dead and dozens of them were slaughtered by the Sinners during the raid on Calw. Although we don't learn what happens to the organization after that, it's unlikely for them to be a threat any more, assuming if it's not a portion of the Wing's executive branch and the Wing's management doesn't hire new personnel.
Understanding the rules of an Abnormality is the first step to surviving it.
Unfazed Everyman: They don't seem overly bothered by Love Town, although this could be because they're used to this sort of thing. An invitation to the Library or the presence of dangerous Distortions in the Trains, however, still understandably scare them.

Valor without forethought is little more than a bluff, and there is more strength in discretion than recklessness.” I wonder if you remember this piece of advice I gave when you were still prone to take action without thinking. I remember you conceding it and taking a step back. Although I gave you that advice, now I understand that it’s not without fault. Thinking alone doesn’t make progress, and too much caution can be a harm to oneself. I had the prudence, and you had the unhesitating action. We helped each other with our strengths, and we could just live on by dealing with matters at hand back in the day. Maybe those were the days when we could laugh and lament the most, and carry out our lives just like that. But now we’ve come too far to go back—so did you, and so did Charles’ Office.
Very well. I shall repeat myself, though the answer remains unchanged.

W Corp's singularity is marketed as the ability to warp through space to reach any place within 10 seconds. In reality, W Corp's singularity is the ability to wipe/reset people back into a previous state, allowing the WARP train passengers to perceive their trips in the WARP train as lasting only 10 seconds when in reality their trip lasted thousands of years.
W Corp. (Unmarked Spoilers)
W Corp. / Warp. Of course, their Dark Secret is that their Singularity is actually Material Reconstruction, which gives the hollowed out W of their logo even more redundancy.
W Corp’s Singularity is the restoration of a previous status. To put it in layman’s terms, even if your body is crushed to a pulp, it can be restored to a recorded state as long as all the pieces remain.

Warning: Excessive puns may trigger a containment breach.
Warning: My puns are as dangerous as a breach event.
We Have Reserves: On a corporation-wide level: even should a Wing fall, which has happened several times in the City's history, eventually an upstart corporation will patent a new Singularity with the Head and be uplifted into a new Wing, after which they take control of the previous Wing's Nest and business resumes as usual.
We Used to Be Friends: She knew Gebura in her original life. The other Fourth Pack leaders warn her to not let it affect her morale.
We almost got into serious danger one time. The two of us were hanging out until after dark, and ran into something nasty in a remote street. It happened when I was a little kid, so my memory of that is blurry… All I can remember is looking at San’s back, standing in front me holding a tree branch he hurriedly picked up. My heart was racing with fright, but looking at his shivering legs made me chuckle a little on the inside. I don’t really remember what happened after that, as I said.
We are Tailors who consume people and make silk out of them. Whether it’s melting people inside our belly and congealing them in a mold, or it’s unraveling humans into the thread they’re really made of, the fundamentals do not matter. This technology doesn’t originally belong to us. We merely took hold of a technology that came off patent when a Wing was broken. The only thing that matters is that silk made from humans has strength that differentiates it from ordinary thread. Only those who crave it visit us.
We are Udjat. While it’s a Grade 1 Office on the surface, we only receive requests from one person. It exists for Lady Dias and Lady Dias alone. We are ready to perform any feat that she demands. Her pure ambition will bring her to a position of great power one day. We simply serve as stepping stones for her ascent to the top.
We are neither completely bound nor entirely free; our journey is a dance between intention and circumstance.
We didn’t start out as Fixers at the beginning. No, we were in fact part of a homicidal Syndicate. Just see how intimidating we look. We used to be murder for hire in District 23. It was a small Syndicate ran by Naoki, I, and a few others, but our influence started to expand bit by bit since the young and talented Taein joined us. Our current boss… was originally the representative of an Office we raided. They visited us once they heard that we shredded their Fixers brutally and hung their ragged corpses on the streets like scarecrows. Said they’ll need people like us.
We learn who we are not in comfort, but in challenge.
We live in turbulent times when Wings are destined to fall behind in the market if they don’t respond to patent disputes effectively, big or small! It’s one of the reasons patent wars are that much important. Those megacorporations sue one another for patent infringement, or accuse one another for stealing their patent… Us small fries can watch the giants clash without worrying about getting caught in the crossfire; in fact, we benefit from such conflict! There are unspoken rules that you need to remember to keep your stake in a patent war: One must patent their technology separately for areas outside of the Nest or other domain under their jurisdiction, one must avoid admitting to infringement before carefully reviewing the lawsuit, the rights to a technology cannot be protected if its details were publicized through advertisements or such before the patent was registered, et cetera… Patent wars break out for so many reasons, it’ll take a day and a half to list them out!
We live in turbulent times when Wings are destined to fall behind the market if they don't respond to patent disputes effectively, big or small! It's one of the reasons patent wars are that much important.
We merely watch events unfold as bystanders. You walk along a path, but was it you who laid the path there? You didn’t teach yourself to lift your legs to propel you forward; they simply moved. Furthermore, the decision to walk wasn’t our own, either. Still too many believe that they moved their legs out of their own volition. It’s a shame to see them struggle to escape the flow, for they’re only straying away from salvation.
We must exercise concentration and resoluteness in all situations. Be diligent to detect the emergence of a new flow, yet be wary not to be swept by the flow yourself. As our occupation involves placing some on low positions and holding others in high regard, we must secure the values that constitute our frame, while amending outdated parts of our ideologies. Thus, we need to have an open mind that can accept opinions that differ from our own in moderation. Be willing to listen to the criticism of others and acknowledge it, but be cautious not to throw yourself into confusion by accepting any and all opinions, changing yourself without due consideration. Change what needs to be changed, but be stubborn about the rules we’ve maintained. In conclusion, we mustn’t fall for temptation or deception.
We need hope to keep moving forward, even when logic says otherwise."
We once tried a Sephirot talent show. Result: chaos, two breaches, and a surprisingly good rap from Hod.
We value the art of violence more than anything here; those with an unscathed body are not permitted to join us. A swordsman who does not have a single blade scar on his skin is doubtlessly too careful when he wields his weapon, and his inane hesitation will be an obstacle. Too irresolute to endure the wounds his own blade would leave, let alone the assault of others… A body free of scars is proof of cowardice. Alas, it would be wise not to expose your wounds outside of those on your face.
Weaklings will get hounded.
Wearing E.G.O is wearing a story—choose which stories you carry.

Weird Currency: Canto VI of Limbus Company reveals that time itself is used as a form of currency in conjunction with the usual Ahn in the District.
We’ve got two options! First: don’t eat anything. Hey, I’m not suggesting that we all starve to death. Your body is taught to eat! So what if you changed that habit? Maybe instead of food, your empty innards could be filled with possibilities of some other kind? If you ain’t a fan of that, then there’s the second option: eat anything! Just trace the smell of the blood, and stuff what you find in your mouth as your brain tells you to.

What I’m saying is, dreaming won’t do jack shit for you. They didn’t end up here because they gave up trying. Hell, they wouldn’t have set foot on this gutter in the first place if they had what it takes to achieve their dreams. You get it now? Pete’s a huge idiot.
What Measure Is a Non-Human?: In general, the Head absolutely hates anything nonhuman, to the point that they will send Arbiters in order to deal with the nonhuman threat and anyone who knows how to create them, whether mechanical or biological.

What is the right way to live a life in this place, I must wonder? I’m not even dreaming of a life that I can be proud of; how does one achieve the feeling that their life is bearable to live, let alone be satisfied with it? I thought I had found an answer to that… But in the end, I couldn’t escape the Prescripts. The Prescripts are the City’s will as it is my will. I’ve realized my limit. I feel as if I’ve hit some kind of wall I can’t overcome. However, I don’t feel all too forlorn and miserable. Maybe there’ll be someone who can ride along with the flow, rather than break it. It just won’t be me; I’m not fit to accomplish such things.

What’s so difficult about watching the security feed all day, you ask? Sure, you could think that if you’re unfamiliar with how things work here. But imagine having to check the feeds for tens and even hundreds of rooms that have ten cams each. The workload is spread over multiple people, of course, but each of us still has dozens of screens to stare at, it makes my eyes spin like a top. Besides, some people are sneaky enough to pull trickery off camera, and some incidents might occur during maintenance hours. This job is such a busy one, two eyes just aren’t enough. When you’re checking one case, another call comes in, when you’re done checking that, more calls wait for you… The shortage of manpower is driving me crazy, I swear.

When Carmen learned of this, she didn’t say much. She didn’t make a big fuss about it or suggest trying something with it right away. She only said that wielding this power is more important than simply manifesting it, so I shouldn’t be lazy… She went back to work after leaving that peculiar piece of advice. Maybe she didn’t want me to feel too much pressure.
When I become a proud and dashing Fixer, I’ll buy a Nest migration ticket and get a nice new home for you. I could buy my gear at a workshop thanks to your help, and all that… Though that’s not all. You always looked after me, sis. …It’s kind of embarrassing to talk about this. Anyway, don’t worry about me, and do the things you want to do. I know you were always too busy caring for me to pursue your own interests. You offered to give me a prosthetic body or even a minor procedure the last time we met, but… I’m doing fine without any of that stuff. And you got money to earn for yourself. Hngh, chaa… I’m tired, so I’ll be going now. I ran around the whole town chasing a cat all day… Night, sis. I hope we see each other again.
When I first became aware in the facility, everything was unfamiliar and intimidating. I learned that naming my fears aloud, even in solitude, helped me see them for what they were—signals, not sentences. Over time, I found the courage to move forward, not despite my fear, but because of it.
When I first had the sword in my grip, I didn’t feel anything in particular. All I could tell is that it’s just a big, heavy greatsword; nothing out of the ordinary other than its appearance. But when I held the sword a few days later to protect a coworker of mine, I heard a voice. It was the voice of someone desperately yearning for something. Unfortunately, the meaning of that voice was lost on me. Rather… it wasn’t even human speech. An awkward sound mimicking somebody. Noises of teeth grinding, bones crackling, mingling with flesh. Some things collide, fall apart, and mix in irregular patterns as if to mimic the way humans speak. However, that sound was too violent and sharp. The strong obsession of an empty one. Attachment. Void. I’m not sure what word I should use to define this.
When I heard the news and rushed to the scene, only a hideous musician who had concluded his performance and permanently shut the piano’s lid with his torso awaited me. For the first time, emotions I couldn’t understand welled up inside me. It’s hard to define what they were, even now. It felt as if deep tenebrous stains were seeping out of my heart. Alas, I didn’t shed tears before that piano where your body rested—for I soon realized that you were no longer there.
When a human equips E.G.O they are not mentally prepared to wield, the Abnormality within the equipment will one-sidedly whisper into the mind of the user until it eventually takes over their mind. This process is known as E.G.O Corrosion (E.G.O 침식, E.G.O Chimsik), where the Abnormality’s personality gradually overrides the wearer like a ‘shell’ until the equipment in question completely overtakes them, physically transforming the wielder into a monster acting as another instance of the original Abnormality, albeit slayable.
When all is silent, only echoes remain.
When all seems lost, even a whisper of hope can change everything.
When an Office accepts a request, an official deed of contract must be drawn up before the case can be dealt with. It sounds big, but it’s basically just a mutual promise; I think it’s “consideration” in legal terms. The client will pay a certain amount of money as reward, and the Fixers will do their best to resolve the case… They’re plain and natural clauses for the most part. It seems people in this City are prone to breaking promises as simple as those without a contract to bind them, though. In any case, contracts serve as physical evidence to prove our performance and secure our payment when we submit reports to the Association. Without a contract, there’s no assurance that we’ll score a record for our career or get our due payment. To give you an example, Big Sis resolved a huge case the other day, but we got absolutely nothing out of it because she forgot to sign a contract for it.
When departments unite in suppression, chaos and order intertwine. Only through collaboration can balance be restored.
When despair wins, it is only temporary—hope can return with time and support."
When does grieving get easier?
When fear clouds your mind, pause. Breathe. You are capable of more than you realize.
When fear visits, greet it as a guest—let it teach you, but do not let it stay forever.
When one person’s pure ambition and another’s tragic obsession join together, a dream is destined to be born.
When someone you care about is gone, their absence leaves an echo. It is okay to mourn, but remember to celebrate their presence in your life as well.
When suppression ends, the learning begins.
When the clock hits 3 AM, you drag the little shit outside and throw it in the middle of a relatively large street. You return to your home before it’s too late and watch the scene from the window. The time is 3:13 AM; Sweepers crawl out of the dark and sweep the streets clean, collecting all the trash including that noise pollutant.
When you are lost, remember that every path is found by walking.
When you listen, even silence from an Abnormality can be revealing.
When you work with Abnormalities, you soon realize that the line between caution and fear is thin. A careful manager observes, adapts, and learns the subtle language of each entity. Sometimes, survival depends not on strength, but on humility and respect.
When you work with Cane Office, the process you have to follow will usually be simple outside of a few special cases. All you need to do is make a summary of all the details for the deal you’re making and visit the Office. And don’t forget to take all the relevant documents with you: Notarial deed of promissory note, Migration permit for the Nest (or the Backstreets) of District OO, Deed of forward contract, and everything else related to the deal. If you safely finished your business with Cane Office, those documents will become powerful pieces of evidence that’ll protect you in case a dispute breaks out for whatever reason.
Where we live, there is nothing that can be achieved with your own will. A flow that we cannot go against dictates us. What we call “gears” are simply there to show the flow. You can’t see it with your eyes. Nobody knows who created this massive current, or why we must follow it. This flow never leads us to bad places, however. Rather, thinking that such a place exists is an act of defiance in itself.

While A Corp. is directly managed by the Head, the Head has two more Wings that work directly under them: B Corp. (also known as The Eye) and C Corp. (also known as The Claw). To better quash their opposition, the Head possesses a wide array of shock troops that no other entity in the City possesses, such as Arbiters (Directly managed by the Head), Beholders (Managed by B Corp/the Eye), Claws (Managed by C Corp/The Claw), and their own Fixers. These units are considered unparalleled combatants of the City, and even a sole agent dispatched from them would usually spell doom to the offender. Hypocritically, despite the Head having made the laws that banned lethal firearms from being created or used, their troops make liberal use of obviously lethal long-range weapons. Employees from various corporations or associations could also report any signs of misconduct for the Head to deal with, as seen in the case of Michelle and Yujin. They are also responsible for creating Sweepers to unleash on the Backstreets.
While I was dithering, she sighed at me and approached me. Did I frustrate her? Is she gonna kill me now? Was my savior an impatient and ill-tempered freak after all? I collapsed on the floor. I mean, think about it. A scary humanoid thing fully covered in armor, walking toward you with a greatsword decorated with red flesh… It was a miracle I didn’t faint on the spot. She grabbed my arm, set me up right, and said in a dry voice: “It’s not the strong who survive, it’s the survivors who are strong.” Then she shoved my back, and I started running before I could thank her. I didn’t look back once. I was so embarrassed, comparing myself to her.
While most Distortions retain none of their humanity and only manifest in ways for "claiming and expressing their desires [one-dimensionally]," in certain cases an individual will be able to fully retain reason after Distorting, though this generally only makes them more dangerous in that they can plan and strategize while still pursuing their desires. Furthermore, certain Distortions have the ability of physically manipulating others around them, either Distorting them as well or altering them into other forms.
While the issue was alleviated with Library of Ruina and later installments of the franchise, with Abnormalities being referred to as ‘Gensōtai’ (幻想体, げんそうたい), the JP fandom still habitually refer Abnormalities as ‘Abunōmariti’ (アブノーマリティ).
While there have been several Wing collapses in the City's history, the most recent collapse, that of Lobotomy Corporation, the L Corp of Nest L, is unprecedented. This is because L Corp's collapse was accompanied by the White Nights and Dark Days, which impacted the entire City and not just its own Nest like other past collapses.[21]

And on top of those twelve is the Hana Association. Our lives are subordinate to layer upon layer of hierarchy.

Why ‘Colors’ of all terms when there are many other stylish words to choose from? I have no comment to make, since I don’t know the reason myself. My assumption is that colors are used because giving people hues representative of them makes it easier to refer to and remember them by. It may not be the answer you were expecting, but it can’t be helped; the Colors have their own ways of working, and they have basically nothing in common. It’s akin to how visible colors have their own vibrant characteristics. In that sense, the term ‘Colors’ isn’t entirely off-putting.

Willfully Weak: Each Heishou Striker in-game is level 60, well above what the Sinners are capable of at the time. However, as they were ordered to assassinate the targets and not engage them in direct combat, they have a Repressed Bloodthirst effect that weakens their stats and effectively lowers them to level 50, more in-line with what the Sinners have been facing so far.

With these ‘families’ of 3 or more Abnormalities, it is not unusual for them to attempt to merge together or summon a greater threat—such as an ALEPH-class Abnormality—which will endanger and potentially destroy the entire facility they inhabit. It is due to the disastrous consequences of housing an entire set of closely related Abnormalities that facilities usually limit the number of these pairings and groups, either by placing their Containment Units far apart or splitting them across different branch facilities.
With this, Angela snaps her fingers and teleports Netzach and his assistants to them, saying that she has the power to track down and move anyone in the Library.

When selecting an employee to perform a work on an Abnormality, the overall  Success Rate of the work will be shown as: Very Low, Low, Common, High or Very High. If the Work Favor of the respective work is not yet unlocked, the  Success Rate will remain hidden and classified as 'Unknown.
Works and Interactions: The main interaction with the Abnormalities are by sending Agents to their Containment Units to perform one of the four works available:  Instinct,  Insight,  Attachment, and  Repression. Depending on the work preference and other stats, the Abnormality will produce an amount of  E-Boxes. PE-Boxes are positive energy that will be collected at the end of the task and added to the Energy Quota, while NE-Boxes are negative energy that is discarded as a 'fail work', which will also damage the employee working with the Abnormality.

Xiao	Chapter 3.3	1	 Book of Chun
Xiao was a cold person who wouldn’t easily show her feelings. Even though the Liu consists of those who only face forward and never express any emotion in battle, Xiao was especially hard-edged above the rest. I came to wonder if she was capable of possessing emotions at all. Her tone was dry in the most upsetting situations, and she seemed apathetic to the loss of several colleagues. Never showing her emotions in response anything, but thoroughly looking after herself. That was my impression of Xiao. I thought the path Xiao was walking was completely different from mine. We disagreed on every aspect, from strategies to personalities; I thought my relationship with her would stay a formal relation between two coworking directors of an association.

Yeah. I guess it’s fairer to say that I travel to a completely different space. Ever thought about the possibility that an infinity of different versions of the world you live in might exist? Let’s say that you sidetracked on your way home and were killed by some Syndicate members that ambushed you. But in another world, you might have decided you wanna go straight home, and the assault would’ve never happened. Or, you might have noticed the Syndicate members as soon as you stepped into the wrong alley and quickly got back on track. Those small choices can add up, and result in countless worlds where countless outcomes unfold. …I know what you’re thinking; this isn’t logic that can realistically be proven. I know all of this sounds unbelievable. People can’t understand me because of that, and even I have difficulty explaining myself.
Yeah… I— I should have died.” Carmen’s answer, on the other hand, was likely sincere. Everyone stood still. A crack appeared in our minds which we never thought would crumble. Maybe we all expected it to happen deep down.

Yesod Meltdown
Yesod comments about how complex the subjects of the books on Tiphereth's floor are. Tiphereth calls him out for seeming to treat her like a child, but explains she knows he is simply worried about her since she did not have an education like the other Patron Librarians did in their original lives, She brushes it off, saying that she knows Yesod isn't making a joke at her expense, knowing his serious personality. Malkuth and Netzach point out how she used to say she hated all four of them and considered herself superior. Tiphereth apologizes for being immature and says she now knows not to belittle them, either. She hopes that they can stay friendly and not feel pressured by her, and concludes that she is fine with Yesod's comment, since it means he acknowledged how hard she is working. Hod is appreciative of Tiphereth's growth and compliments her positivity, though Tiphereth says she would have still been angry if anyone other than Yesod made that comment.
Yesod wonders what Chesed and Gebura are busy with: Tiphereth says Chesed is providing his hospitality to the Assistant Librarians from various Floors who stop by for coffee, while Gebura is meditating and Tiphereth says she would feel bad to interrupt her. She hastily adds that none of the four helping her need to stay if they don't want to, feeling apologetic after hearing Netzach's comment. Malkuth reassures her all of them are willing to help, even if Netzach tends to complain.

You are braver than you believe, and your fears do not define you.
You are not alone—fear is a universal experience, not a personal flaw.
You are not defined by your suffering, but by the meaning you choose to create from it.
You are not less for being afraid; you are more for confronting it.
You are not your fear, but your choices in the face of it.
You can be afraid and still be strong.
You can heal, carrying their memory as a source of strength.
You can let fear inform you, but don’t let it decide your path.
You can’t always control what you fear, but you can choose how you respond.
You gave a fine speech, but I must wonder if you’re truly upset for the sake of Salvador and your other late colleagues.
You have lots of things to prepare before you can jump into the Fixer business. Starting with choosing equipment, you’ll need clothes to protect your bodily accessories, et cetera… But, before any of that, body augmentation comes first. There’s no point having masterful skills or fancy equipment if your body can’t keep up, y’know? And training hard isn’t gonna do it. There’s a limit to training your body, and the fittest body is still no match for mechanical prosthetics or bionic organs. You gotta be able to keep your body intact to do anything, so you’re pretty much forced to spend a fortune on it.
You hear that news? We’re about to collide with Kingfishers again.
You heard about how people use belts to choke others, didn’t ya? These accessories are similar to that. They’re useful for beating someone to death, though I gotta take the risk that comes from using ‘em. Expensive gadgets crafted by premium workshops have almost zero side effects. On the other hand, this ring for example lets me deliver a harder blow with my punches, but it chafes the skin of my hand at the same time. This one’s on me for using it for too long, and I hear quality products usually get regular repairs and maintenance to prevent that… The side effects on my gear’s pretty minor and negligible, but in worse cases, you get some poor sod whose neck got snapped by the necklace they were wearing.
You know what’s funnier? Even kids would group themselves according to what part of the streets they live in. They’d even shun the others whose clothes or manner didn’t fit their turf’s style. I had no choice but to accept this sad truth.
You know, the Syndicate that’s been struggling with finance and feuds between members recently. They seemed to be getting back on their feet after raiding the Constellars, but it looks like that didn’t last long.
You may deceive your foes in battle, but remember that you must be true to yourself at all times.
You may never stop missing them, but you will learn to live with it. Let yourself grieve at your own pace.
You may not stop missing them, but over time, the ache softens into remembrance.
You never truly lose the bond; it transforms into quiet strength within you.
You said I am strong, but the truth is that I was weak and fainthearted until the very last time I faced you. I have only grown so ironclad after I lost you. Why did I miss everything while you were still by my side? Why do I spend the whole night longing for you and regretting only after you have parted from me? I do have one regret regarding you: that I could not trust my feelings for you. That I was too afraid to tell you that you’re my everything the night before you left me.
You should’ve been the one to die…” The other kid, who was now all alone, mumbled crying. Her words had no weight to it. She probably spouted what she didn’t sincerely mean, because the situation was too much for her.
You tell me. Maybe there was something more important than making a fortune and spending the rest of his life in comfort for him…
You thought opening gates to different dimensions was our Singularity? That’s actually a former Singularity a fallen Wing used to own. It wasn’t a very well-known Wing, so you probably won’t recognize it even if I told you its name. Point is, that Wing discovered a way to open gates between dimensions. The ability to create rifts in space. The Wing sadly never knew how to utilize that stunning technology they’d found; the Nest ended up falling before it could find a proper use for the Singularity, and the company now known as W Corp. spent a huge sum of money to purchase it.
You use her original  Max HP for calculations.
You wonderin’ how things were in the alleys I lived? Couldn’t afford to pay protection fees to a Syndicate, so the Sweepers came down at night and collected most of my neighbors. I had to witness ‘em take chunks of flesh outta my parents and brothers while they were still breathing. Don’t pity me, though. My story ain’t nothing special around here.
Your courage is measured not by the absence of fear, but by your willingness to act in its presence.
Your fears are a map—follow them and learn about yourself.
Your feelings are valid; anger can be a way of processing pain.
Your heart can hold both remembrance and hope without betrayal.
Your kind likes to claim that something is out of the ordinary when it’s only different from what you’ve seen and experienced before. So you fear it, and try to exclude it from your herd. But you see, there’s no real justification for your kind to condemn us.
Your loss may shape you, but it does not define your entire story.
Your pain is seen and understood. There is no shame in sorrow.
Your request does not compute. Try again.
Your willingness to face fear inspires others more than you know.
Your words are enigmatic, but I will do my best to understand.
You’re not a woman of style, are you. It’s more fun to talk like we’re secret agents exchanging confidential info when we’re discussing topics like this! It’s stylish that way. Forget it, R Corp. has been investigating something of late. It’s…
You’re pausing it at just the right moment like it’s a rerun you’ve watched over and over… There’s got to be a reason.
You’re the noisiest one here and you already stick out like a sore thumb, so just say it already.

–Adam, Lobotomy Corporation Day 49 Story
–Angela to Roland
‘A guest walked into a restaurant for a meal, but then the chef fell in love with them! They had the perfect amount of tenderness and girth. The chef pulled out a knife, and the guest ended up on a plate. You'll become the food you appreciated one day, and others will appreciate what you've become.’
‘The Musicians of Bremen’ provided large quantities of meat, though it wasn’t exactly the freshest. Shattered chips of bones were often in the meat, and the mixture of different types would create an odd flavor. Still was a reliable supplier of ingredients, all in all. Outside of special occasions, we’d use them for making experimental dishes or sausages. Oh, speaking of, sausages are made from a mix of several different kinds of meat. You could even find a rat inside at times. Anyway, we rarely sold the dishes made out of their meat other than the sausages. They’d never treat their meat nicely before handing it to us.
‘To Jimin, Do not utter a single word for five days.’
‘To Rimi, Deliver a bacon pizza to Danny’s doorstep on 8th St. before 10 AM sharp on September 14th.’
‘To Sehee, If the first person you meet outside today answers your greetings by lifting their right hand, take their heart out; if the person ignores your greetings, remove your own heart from your body.’
…
…I can’t blame the Association, so I only have myself to fault for failing to save my guys.
…I know how corrupt this Association is. I am woefully aware of Thelma’s cunning and unhinged purpose behind saddling Section 2 with one request after another and wearing us down… I am but waiting for the right time. Waiting and enduring until I seize the chance to bring the Shi back to glory… I firmly believe that everything will take a turn for the better once I take care of this work. I pledge to change the system with my hands… No matter what.
…I’ll go prepare myself.
…That group reportedly appears every time a case of the Distortion is solved. They’re allegedly working as “The Distortion Detective”, but recent witnesses of their appearance were always followed with a Distortion case in the same location. While it’s unclear whether they’re involved in this case… I believe there’s enough reason to be wary of them.
…Um, are you feeling down?
