Her sister died from a disease and the parents passed away. Anya is now 'sleeping' in the Department, and this time, he grants authority to A to wake her up, as the scene gains a green electronic filter.

Dery’s body blew up and weird needles went. Mrs. Madrid, who was standing in front of me, was struck with one of the needles.

Section 2, the team with Mei and Cecil, consists of careful and level-headed Fixers. They go quite well with Director Lowell because of that.
