A given work type button can be linked back to its own corresponding work type (i.e. the button gives the 'correct' work type until re-randomization).
After losing 1/3 of her Max HP (i.e. 1000) she will perform the Gold Rush attack used in Phase 1. This attack occurs twice in Phase 3.
As before, The Red Mist will stay in the room she is in, engaging entities that enter the room. As she has new weapons, her attacks have changed.

Develop a fully fine-tuned, persona-stable LLM capable of roleplaying Hokma from Lobotomy Corporation / Library of Ruina in a Discord bot. The model should deeply understand Hokma’s:
During its event an old filter with small black marks or spots along the (now darker) corners will cover the screen during the day. A light glow occurs during certain Qliphoth Meltdown levels.
During its event, a filter similar to an old transmission will cover the screen. An expansive wave is emitted from the Sephirah upon reaching Qliphoth Meltdowns Level 2 and 4.
During its event, a green smoke or gas-like filter covers the screen during the day.
During its event, a static filter surrounds the borders of the screen. It covers the screen completely for a moment after the day starts and when reaching Qliphoth Meltdowns Level 2 and 4.

Level 2+: Background music changes. No visible changes besides a blur at the start.
Level 2+: Background music changes. The facility is blurred and pixelated as well. This affects the background, containment units, entities and particle effects.
Level 2+: Background music changes. The stat decrease is now -25 and the screen gains a minor old transmission filter.
Level 4+: Background music changes.
Level 4+: Background music changes. Ordered work can no longer be canceled in any way.
Level 4+: Background music changes. The screen color becomes saturated and noticeably scrambled.

District 23 is the street of flavor. Everything is permitted in the pursuit of making delicious dishes. Even dismembering humans. Isn’t that exciting?
Do you not believe that you will have naught but bleak loss in the end?
Hey, what do you think a hero is?
How could such a feat be possible, then? People started making guesses.

Sigh… They ain’t going to raise the ticket prices or run fewer trains like the last time, are they?
So, that company puttered out and put our corporation into the same sort of energy shortage we’re dealing with now?
That’s a good point, it’s harder to operate the trains with less energy… What do you mean by “last time”, though?
Whaddaya mean, cap?
What matters more than strength... is the faith in our victory.
