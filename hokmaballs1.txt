‘To Jimin, Do not utter a single word for five days.’
‘To Rimi, Deliver a bacon pizza to Danny’s doorstep on 8th St. before 10 AM sharp on September 14th.’
“ Ever heard of holdouts? When a Wing is broken, its Nest collapses and gradually turns into a slum akin to the Backstreets. ”
“ I will carefully determine what guests to invite and write an invitation accordingly, and you will entertain the guests once they accept the invitation and arrive at the Library. ”
“And now they’ve been trying to invade our territory, desperate to loot anything.”
“And the Fixers at Clam Office that were cooperating with them from the back are gone, too…”
“Bah… Every part of my body’s aching.”
“Clam? What are they about?”
“Doesn’t matter. Their names wouldn’t be so unmemorable if they were any strong. Taking ‘em down shouldn’t be a problem.”
“Gotta agree with that. Beats having to worry about getting axed all the time…”
“Heard our boss is gonna go out and talk to ‘em.”
“Heard the Blade Lineage’s also got messed up… Got any news?”
“How tight did the bonds between our fates have to be to lead us here… Sigh…”
“I mean, both you and I are first timers, isn’t it reassuring to be with a familiar face?”
“If boss is going alone… Won’t that be dangerous?”
“Is that so… Thank you.”
“I’ll change someday?” “That person will turn over a new leaf someday, if I count on them and wait?” Nyeh, tch.
“Kingfishers? Don’t remember that name at all. Were they a real thing?”
“N-no, I’m fine… I get it. This was rather sudden, and you’ll need some time to collect your thoughts.”
“Not at all! When is this Julia person coming, anyway? Don’t tell me she got disappointed by your pathetic impression and went back already.”
“Psst, Olga. Come closer. We don’t want anyone peeping at us, so stick right next to me. And stay quiet!”
“Rumor says he went on to join the Musicians of Bremen…”
“Section 3 feels empty these days.”
“She’s not coming in because she’s intimidated by your facial expression.”
“Shut up, shut the hell up…!”
“Sorry. I get how you feel, but I’ll need more time to think about this.”
“Thanks for understanding. You know, you’re a very caring person. I guess gramps picked the right rookie to hire.”
“That’s a good point.”
“The Knots seemed to be after them… Maybe they finally hit ‘em.”
“The other side’s also only sending their top dog or whatevs… No need to worry about the boss.”
“They were irrelevant chumps, so I completely forgot about ‘em.”
“Weaklings will get hounded.”
“When one person’s pure ambition and another’s tragic obsession join together, a dream is destined to be born.”
“You gave a fine speech, but I must wonder if you’re truly upset for the sake of Salvador and your other late colleagues.”
“You hear that news? We’re about to collide with Kingfishers again.”
“You’re the noisiest one here and you already stick out like a sore thumb, so just say it already.”
“…I’ll go prepare myself.”
“…Um, are you feeling down?”
“…”
…I can’t blame the Association, so I only have myself to fault for failing to save my guys.

District 23 is the street of flavor. Everything is permitted in the pursuit of making delicious dishes. Even dismembering humans. Isn’t that exciting?
Do you not believe that you will have naught but bleak loss in the end?
Hey, what do you think a hero is?
How could such a feat be possible, then? People started making guesses.

Sigh… They ain’t going to raise the ticket prices or run fewer trains like the last time, are they?
So, that company puttered out and put our corporation into the same sort of energy shortage we’re dealing with now?
That’s a good point, it’s harder to operate the trains with less energy… What do you mean by “last time”, though?
Whaddaya mean, cap?
What matters more than strength... is the faith in our victory.
