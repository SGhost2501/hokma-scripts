Abnormalities if their creation is closely related to humans (ex. Mountain of Smiling Bodies)
And Your Reward Is Clothes: Kill her using Gebura in the final Act of R Corp. II, and Gebura gets a unique Battle Symbol in the form of rabbit ears to wear.
At the last phase: the player can pause (Hokma Suppression effect will kill/panic random employees).
Based on the Seven Deadly Sins that humans commit within the City.
Blue-and-Orange Morality: They kill people over strange taboos and hate prosthetics for no apparent reason, making them some of the more logically alien Wings.

Kaizo Trap: In the 30th of April Update, the Head's agents can actually kill you as a post-credits encounter, but the "win condition" is still the same as before.
Loophole Abuse: Subverted. Despite the Taboos being technically laws, if you breach a Taboo in the Night of the Backstreets (where laws supposedly don't apply), you'll get killed anyways.
Michelle snitches to the head because she feels guilty about all the death happening
More experiments with cogito results in the death of giovanni
N Corp is very anti-mechanical prosthetics for no known reason, to the point that they will attack and slaughter entire cities in the Nests of other Wings over it.
Nebulous Evil Organisations: There's nobody in the City who does not know about the Wings, and their obsession for wealth pales in front of their obsession for death and weirdness.
Not-So-Safe Harbor: U Corp is full of them, stuffed to the brim with merchants, swindlers, pirates, murderers, and other sketchy folk.
On Agent Death:
On Kill

Roland takes him out but angelica dies
Teammate Death
The Blood-Red Night (Manifested after the light released them from the book, their previous status as a Bloodfiend was the result of another entity's influence.)
The Blood-red Night
The Dreaded: The Claw is a reviled existence amongst the City, and for a good reason; if you have one going after you, then you are almost always going to be dead.
The Head has its own Taboos that basically act as universal laws for the Wings, to the point that a breaking them is a death sentence for a Wing.
The Heavy: Out of the Head agent types that will kill you, you are most likely going to run into these instead of an Arbiter. Not that it's not enough to kill you anyways.
The Puppeteer (Unknown reason how it was manifested, but implied to be because of Roland destroying his workshop and his "son".)
The Wing's Director Hermann leads an expedition to collect the Golden Boughs to destroy the Mirror Worlds.
Thus, if you’re looking to make a request for someone’s death, we recommend seeking other Associations for it.
V Corp. 80,000 residents of its Nest are killed by the Distortion known as The Crying Children, which leads the Wing to focus its attention on the Distortion Phenomenon.[11]
Zerg Rush: Their main fighting style seems to have revolved around all-out attacks using their spliced soldiers, who rush through enemy lines by the hundreds like a tide.
[Abnormality] has escaped. I do not wish to see you suffer for the death of your employees.
“Oh, didn’t you hear the news? Many of them died in that incident with the Distortion last time. Even the guy we counted on resigned and ran off…”
