What matters more than strength... is the faith in our victory.
Trust in yourselves. We should base our actions on the premise that we shall manage this without fail.
You may deceive your foes in battle, but remember that you must be true to yourself at all times.
Let us begin, then. You have come to the point of no return.
As long as we are chained to our lives, we ought to live.
All deeds require the same resolve to pull oneself through.
It seemed to have ended, yet it begins once more.
I urge you to gain composure. Opening your eyes comes next.
What meaning could I give to the work I do solely because I cannot find rest.
On Kill
Relying on brute strength alone to push through is possibly the most imprudent thing you could do.
All of us are simply performing our duties.
May you rest in peace, at the very least.
There cannot be a good reason for me to take your life, no. I am merely in a hurry to end this work.
Teammate Death
In the end, this is all a pointless errand.
One could make endless questions as to why this must be taken so far.
Even if it is impossible to move onward in this place, we must move nonetheless.
One does not easily... take all possibilities into consideration.
Death
Victory
Overconfidence is the greatest enemy. We must humbly keep our post.
Did you truly believe that there was clear benefit to be reapt from this battle.
Do you not believe that you will have naught but bleak loss in the end?
...It seems the work has been done, so let us organize the books now.
There is no halting now. We have already made the first step.
