"Every Abnormality may not have a reason to exist, but they all have a will to persist."
Dong-hwan the Grade 1 Fixer • Night Awls • The Udjat • Mirae Life Insurance • Leaflet Workshop • Bayard
However, I realized it only just now. What I felt wasn’t hope, and that ignoring that Prescript and taking my own life as I’d planned might have been a truer expression of my free will.
Includes Abnormalities that do not exist in physical reality and are closer to intangible phenomena (ex. 1.76 MHz)
I’m not a huge fan of the jobs I’m doing right now, of course. I mean, sure, I wouldn’t say no to some flashier requests. I just accepted to carry on with my life.
L'heure de Loup (Unknown reason how it was manifested, but implied to be because of Roland's single-handed rampage annihilating majority of the Middle's Operations.)
Leeroy Jenkins: This is why they weren't contracted with L Corp: The collateral damage caused by their strength and aggression would've been too much for a fragile research facility to handle.
Nanomachines: What their Singularity supposedly is, nanomachine solutions that work to restore damaged tissue and bodily functions. The truth is a bit more complicated.
One could make endless questions as to why this must be taken so far.
See here for Garion's third life.
See here for more information about Garion's first and second life.
That gave us a bigger thing to worry about than an upcoming destruction. A war is about to happen? Nikolai collected her thoughts and calmly asked why a war was going to occur.
The 8 o'Clock Circus (Unknown reason how it was manifested.)
The Church of Gears Leader (Unknown reason how it was manifested, likely further distorted by Argalia upon being recruited.)
The Eighth Chef (Unknown reason how it was manifested.)
The Musicians of Bremen (Unknown reason how it was manifested, likely further distorted by Argalia upon being recruited.)
The Pianist (Unknown reason how it was manifested.)
The Reindeer Team's Shock and Awe powers come at a cost of their own sanity, meaning extended warfare leads to their members going insane.
There also exists ‘families’ of Abnormalities, in which all embody concepts that share a common theme, grouping them together as an interconnected series.
These Key Page Stories exist in the game files but are not obtainable in-game.
Walking Spoiler: It's hard to talk about them at all without discussing the truth behind the WARP Trains and W Corp's Singularity.
We Used to Be Friends: She knew Gebura in her original life. The other Fourth Pack leaders warn her to not let it affect her morale.
Yesterday's Promise (Unknown reason how it was manifested, but implied to be in part by Roland's contract leading to his team's devastation.)
“ Though there was another reason to do something about that L Corp: It produced a massive amount of fumes. ”
“Cloudy bastards… Why’re they picking at us so much? We’ve taken some serious damage on our side.”
“I wonder why he quit, though. Sure, the work here can be tough, but… isn’t it still easy compared to some others?”
“Right, that happened. I guess that’s why the empty seats felt even more noticeable… He seemed pretty refreshed and relaxed on his last day.”
“Right… They’re weaklings individually, that’s why they like to move in packs.”
“Why would he join that weird funky band?”
“You tell me. Maybe there was something more important than making a fortune and spending the rest of his life in comfort for him…”
“You’re pausing it at just the right moment like it’s a rerun you’ve watched over and over… There’s got to be a reason.”

Why am I bringing this up all of a sudden? I don’t know. I was just reminded of the old times seeing San kneel down for the sake of his Office juniors. He never changes, huh?
